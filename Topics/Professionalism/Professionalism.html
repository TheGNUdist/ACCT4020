						<h1>Becoming a Professional</h1>
					</header>

					<section>
						<h2>Introduction</h2>
						<p>The Merriam-Webster dictionary defines professionalism as, "the skill, judgment, and polite behavior that is expected from a person who is trained to do a job well," and, "the conduct, aims, or qualities that mark a profession or a professional person." The former definition provides us with three traits of a professional: skill, judgment and politeness, but the latter encourages additional investigation to enumerate those "qualities that mark a professional person." Although any profession may suffice as an example, one's own profession is likely of the highest relevance. The American Institute for Certified Public Accountants (AICPA) highlights the following characteristics in its Code of Professional Conduct: diligence, competence, responsibility, integrity and objectivity. Because a list of professional traits without further explanation cannot facilitate adoption, individual treatment of each is warranted. First, however, one caveat is in order. These characteristics should not be viewed merely as the attributes of the good employee. Professionalism extends beyond the workplace to encompass a professional's manner in all facets of life.</p>

						<h2>Diligence</h2>
						<p>George C. Scott in his Oscar-winning portrayal of George S. Patton, Jr. provides us with two illustrations of diligence. Despite the occasional vulgarity of his manner, Scott recites a rousing monologue to troops facing deployment to the front lines of the Great World War II:</p>
						<blockquote>
							<p>When you were kids, you all admired the champion marble-shooter, the fastest runner, the big league ballplayers, the toughest boxers. Americans love a winner. Americans play to win all the time. That's why Americans have never lost and will never lose a war. Because the very thought of losing is hateful to Americans. We have the best spirit and the best men in the world. Some of you boys I know are wondering whether or not you'll chicken out under fire. Don't worry about it. I can assure you that you will all do your duty. There's another thing I want you to remember. I don't want to get any messages saying that we are holding our position. We're not holding anything. Let the Hun do that. We are <em>advancing constantly</em>, and we're not interested in holding onto anything except the enemy! All right now you know how I feel. Oh. I will be proud to lead you wonderful guys into battle anytime, anywhere. That's all.</p>
						</blockquote>
						<p>The essence of diligence is captured by two words&mdash;advancing constantly. Diligence is not satisfied with one's best; it demands that one's best become ever better. It is this form of diligence that allows Patton to expect the impossible from his troops when other leaders would shrink. The resulting dialogue presents the second illustration of this principle:</p>
						<blockquote>
							<ul style="list-style-type: none; margin-left: 30px">
								<li>Briefing Officer:We've identified four German armies: the Seventh, Fifth Panzer, Sixth SS Panzer and the Fifteenth. They've hit us with 26 divisions. They overran two regiments of the 106th division, and 7,500 of our men were forced to surrender. But our immediate concern is that von Rundstedt has the 101st Airborne trapped here at Bastogne.</li>
								<li>Beetle:Bastogne, by the way, is the key to this entire area. If we can hold it, we can break up the entire German offensive. If they take it, we're in serious trouble. Ike wants to know if anybody can get up there and relieve the 101st before they're torn to pieces.</li>
								<li>Guingand:I'm afraid there's nothing that Field Marshall Montgomery can do. At any rate, not for some weeks.</li>
								<li>Beetle:What about you, George?</li>
								<li>Patton:I can attack with three divisions in 48 hours.</li>
								<li>Bradley:Well, I'd give myself some leeway if I were you.</li>
								<li>Beetle:Ike wants a realistic estimate, George. You're in the middle of a fight now, and it's&mdash;it's over 100 miles to Bastogne.</li>
								<li>Patton:My staff's already working out the details.</li>
								<li>Beetle:Well, frankly, I don't see how it's possible. Not in this kind of weather.</li>
								<li>Guingand:I should've thought you'd want to fall back and regroup.</li>
								<li>Patton:Not me, Freddy. I don't like to pay for the same real estate twice.</li>
								<li>Tedder:But what about your men? You can't pull them out of the line and cart them off 100 miles, and then expect them to attack without rest.</li>
								<li>Patton:I've trained these men, Arthur. They'll do what I tell 'em to do.</li>
								<li>Guingand:Yeah, perhaps we hadn't realized that you were quite so popular with your troops, General.</li>
								<li>Patton:I'm not. They'll do it because they're good soldiers, and because they realize as I do that we could still lose this war.</li>
								<li>Guingand:Hmm. Then I think I can speak for Field Marshall Montgomery. He'd say you're asking the impossible of your men.</li>
								<li>Patton:Of course he would, 'cause he's never realized that that's what we're in business for.</li>
							</ul>
						</blockquote>
						<p>These examples focus on warfare, but they are just that: examples. Although the organization identified here is the United States Military, all worthwhile professional organizations throughout the world expect hard work and continual improvement of its members.</p>
						<p>Diligence, however, should never supplant prioritization. In other words, it is not professional to work hard without focus. No one can do everything at once. In fact, each individual can only pursue one task at a time. Although this observation is not intended to enter the realm of the metaphysical, it is well documented that multi-tasking is not the result of the brain working on two tasks simultaneously, but rather the frequent switching of focus from one task to another. This limitation on time allotment necessitates a prioritization of pursuits, but prioritization is made difficult by a common misconception. Few people accept that nothing is more important to a person right now than what that person has chosen to do right now. Even those who understand this struggle with another pitfall of prioritization: uncertainty. Because the future is unknown, it can be difficult or impossible to know what is truly the most important pursuit today. No magic formula exists to resolve this uncertainty, but one fact will help to avoid assigning less valuable tasks a high priority. No amount of diligence will transform a task into a worthwhile pursuit. Shortly after the video game <i>Guitar Hero</i> was released, one gamer expressed the intention to master every level of the most difficult setting. Recognizing the necessary diligence to achieve this goal, one individual responded that channelling that effort into learning to play an actual guitar would be a much wiser choice. Not all difficult tasks should become high priorities, even though they would result in manifestations of diligence. Because time is the most valuable resource&mdash;the value of money pales in comparison&mdash;it is unbecoming a professional to waste it with laziness or with the diligent pursuit of detritus.</p>

						<h2>Competence</h2>
						<p>Competence is knowledge, the pursuit of which is in our very nature. Beginning in infancy, the human mind absorbs information from myriad sources, and with time this information develops into understanding and ability: the ability to speak, to read and write, to reason. This, however, is not enough. A professional must possess a core body of knowledge. Secondary schools, trade schools, apprenticeships, internships, college and on-the-job training provide the setting to acquire this knowledge, but the passive student can derive no value from such educational pursuits because the passive student cannot learn. Teaching is an invitation to receive information; learning is the active acquisition thereof. Analogously, a check may be written, but unless the recipient converts that check into money, it is valueless. The student's responsibility is therefore not to "go to lectures" or "attend school" or even "receive a degree", but rather to seek and obtain knowledge.</p>
						<p>In this hunt for knowledge, it is appropriate that the student lean on the teacher. The onus on the learner is not a proscription against help, and the teacher has both the responsibility and the unique ability to provide that help. The teacher can identify relevant topics, supply useful materials to promote the learning process and expound upon important principles. Furthermore, because the student is now where the teacher once was, the teacher can understand and empathize with the issues that beset a student on the path to becoming a professional.</p>
						<p>The successful student will learn how to take advantage of this aid. First and foremost, the student must trust that the teacher knows what constitutes the professional's core body of knowledge and how to obtain it. If the expectation that a Christmas gift will prove worthless prevents the recipient from unwrapping it, that expectation has fulfilled itself. Likewise, the assumption that the teacher has nothing valuable to contribute will prevent the student from deriving any value. Secondly, life may be full of questions, but the most useful one is, "Why?" Textbooks, reference materials and practice exercises are the primary authorities on <em>what</em> the answers are, and when in doubt, the student should always consult these first. However, comprehension must grow beyond an understanding of what the answers are, and unfortunately, the primary sources of answers to the question, "What?" often fail to include sufficient answers to, "Why?" The teacher assumes the role as the primary authority on <em>why</em> the answers are.</p>
						<p>Having obtained the requisite core of knowledge, the student may be prepared to become a professional, but the professional should never cease to be a student. The landscape of any profession changes with time, and old knowledge loses its relevance. Even in the absence of variability in the profession, an initial education is never exhaustive. Just as the principle of diligence requires continual improvement, competence demands lifelong learning, and while self-education is appropriate, a professional should never settle for self-accreditation.</p>
					</section>

					<section>
						<h2>Responsibility</h2>
						<p>The need for a professional to take ownership of learning is only one manifestation of the principle of responsibility, and indeed, responsibility circumscribes the need to adopt any positive trait or pursue any goal. However, one particularly important dimension of responsibility is accepting ownership of one's choices. The belief that everyone is free to make choices is very popular, and unfortunately, this belief has spawned the expectation that choices should have no consequences, or rather that consequences are an infringement on the individual's right to choose. Those who have served in the military are familiar with the saying, "Freedom is not free." The focus of that saying is the price that military men and women have paid to preserve constitutional freedoms. Because a price was paid, these freedoms were not without cost. Similarly, for each individual, the freedom to choose is not without cost, and that cost comes in the form of consequences. Each time someone makes a choice, that person has also chosen the consequences. A professional accepts consequences with grace and refrains from using current behavior to subvert the consequences of past behavior. Present consequences are the result of past choices, and improved behavior now will only have improved consequences in the future.</p>
						<p>Responsibility extends beyond a professional's own circumstances and even beyond the workplace. Charles Dickens provides a poignant illustration of this fact in his classic novel <i>A Christmas Carol</i>. A conversation early in the book illustrates the dichotomy between the professional's obligation to social welfare and Ebenezer Scrooge's selfish attitude.</p>
						<blockquote>
							<p>[Bob Cratchit], in letting Scrooge's nephew out, had let two other people in. They were portly gentlemen, pleasant to behold, and now stood with their hats off, in Scrooge's office. They had books and papers in their hands, and bowed to him.</p>
							<p>"Scrooge and Marley's, I believe," said one of the gentlemen, referring to his list. "Have I the pleasure of addressing Mr. Scrooge, or Mr. Marley?"</p>
							<p>"Mr. Marley has been dead these seven years," Scrooge replied. "He died seven years ago, this very night."</p>
							<p>"We have no doubt his liberality is well represented by his surviving partner," said the gentlemen, presenting his credentials.</p>
							<p>It certainly was; for they had been two kindred spirits. At the ominous word "liberality," Scrooge frowned, and shook his head, and handed the credentials back.</p>
							<p>"At this festive season of the year, Mr. Scrooge," said the gentleman, taking up a pen, "it is more than usually desirable that we should make some slight provision for the poor and destitute, who suffer greatly at the present time. Many thousands are in want of common necessaries; hundreds of thousands in want of common comforts, sir."</p>
							<p>"Are there no prisons?" asked Scrooge.</p>
							<p>"Plenty of prisons," said the gentleman, laying down the pen again.</p>
							<p>"And the Union workhouses?" demanded Scrooge. "Are they still in operation?"</p>
							<p>"The Treadmill and the Poor Law are in full vigor, then?" said Scrooge.</p>
							<p>"They are. Still," returned the gentleman, "I wish I could say they were not."</p>
							<p>"Both very busy, sir."</p>
							<p>"Oh! I was afraid, from what you said at first, that something had occurred to stop them in their useful course," said Scrooge. "I'm very glad to hear it."</p>
							<p>"Under the impression that they scarcely furnish Christian cheer of mind or body to the multitude," returned the gentleman, "a few of us are endeavouring to raise a fund to buy the Poor some meat and drink, and means of warmth. We choose this time, because it is a time, of all others, when Want is keenly felt, and Abundance rejoices. What shall I put you down for?"</p>
							<p>"Nothing!" Scrooge replied.</p>
							<p>"You wish to be anonymous?"</p>
							<p>"I wish to be left alone," said Scrooge. "Since you ask me what I wish, gentlemen, that is my answer. I don't make merry myself at Christmas, and I can't afford to make idle people merry. I help to support the establishments I have mentioned&mdash;they cost enough: and those who are badly off must go there."</p>
							<p>"Many can't go there; and many would rather die."</p>
							<p>"If they would rather die," said Scrooge, "they had better do it, and decrease the surplus population. Besides&mdash;excuse me&mdash;I don't know that."</p>
							<p>"But you might know it," observed the gentleman.</p>
							<p>"It's not my business," Scrooge returned. "It's enough for a man to understand his own business, and not to interfere with other people's. Mine occupies me constantly. Good afternoon, gentlemen!</p>
							<p>Seeing clearly that it would be useless to pursue their point, the gentlemen withdrew. Scrooge resumed his labours with an improved opinion of himself, and in a more facetious temper than was usual with him.</p>
						</blockquote>
						<p>During that same evening, Christmas Eve, the ghost of Ebenezer Scrooge's former business partner, Jacob Marley, visits him and bemoans never having paid attention to anything other than work. When Scrooge responds with the compliment that Marley had always been "a good man of business," the ghost retorts with the true meaning of the word. "Business! Mankind was my business! The common welfare was my business; charity, mercy, forbearance and benevolence were all my business. The dealings of my trade were but a drop of water in the comprehensive ocean of my business!" Unfortunately, this explanation failed to sway Scrooge, and only the visitation of three Christmas spirits would convince him of the error of his uncharitable ways. In one dramatization of this novel&mdash;appealing again to George C. Scott as Ebenezer Scrooge&mdash;the Ghost of Christmas Present displays a scene of abject poverty. Not yet having learned compassion, Scrooge asks, "Why do you show me this, what has it to do with me?" In another attempt to drive home Marley's earlier point, the Ghost forcefully rebuts, "Are they not of the human race?"</p>
						<p>Although this is a Christmas story, a generalization of the charitable gentleman's observation would take nothing away from its message. "It is desirable that we should make some slight provision for the poor and destitute." An understanding that choices have consequences is not a license to judge others as having earned their misfortune and refuse assistance. Everyone has needs from time to time. According to Maslov's hierarchy, the most fundamental needs are physiological&mdash;food, water, shelter and clothing&mdash;and money serves to satisfy those needs. Other needs are more emotional in nature, and time is the necessary investment to meet these. Whatever the need&mdash;food, clothing, a kind word or a listening ear&mdash;it is everyone's responsibility to contribute to the social welfare. This is not a plea for communism or socialism, but rather for compassion. To paraphrase the Ghost, "Are we not all of the human race?"</p>

						<h2>Integrity and Objectivity</h2>
						<p>Society at large teaches the principle that dishonesty is a social lubricant. The fundamental underpinning of this principle is the assertion that dishonesty is morally superior to honesty. Two popular films support this premise: Liar Liar and Dead Poets Society. In the former, Golden Globe winner Jim Carrey plays a high-powered lawyer whose word counts for nothing. When he is supernaturally forced to tell the truth for 24 hours, he repeatedly finds himself making inappropriate and disadvantageous remarks that he could have avoided had he been able to lie. In the latter, in an Academy Award winning role, the late Robin Williams encourages Todd Anderson (Ethan Hawke) to author an impromptu literary work: "Truth... Truth is like a blanket that always leaves your feet cold. Stretch it, pull it, it will never cover any of us. Kick at it, beat at it, it will never be enough. From the moment we enter crying to the moment we leave dying, it will cover just your head as you wail and cry and scream!"</p>
						<p>This premise is without equivocation false! Dishonesty, including "little white lies" and opacity&mdash;withholding relevant truthful information&mdash;is immoral and unbecoming a professional. Dishonesty serves only to benefit the liar, whereas the truth frees us. No one must carry the burden of a secret if it is not secret. The truth will not protect against the consequences of bad choices, but any professional should take responsibility for bad choices and not use dishonesty to hide them.</p>
						<p>Because society consistently lobbies in favor of dishonesty, these assertions may be difficult to accept, but the story of a former stock market professional provides excellent support for the truth of telling the truth. Nick Leeson brought down the 200-year-old Barings Bank when he accumulated &pound;827 million in trading losses. The bank failure was not precipitated by one bad choice that resulted in a trading loss. The bank failed because Leeson chose to lie about a poor investment decision to avoid negative consequences. When he could not earn the lost money back with subsequent, increasingly risky trades, the negative balance became impossible to hide. Leeson was arrested, and Barings Bank was sold for &pound;1. If he had told the truth about the first bad investment, his reputation would have been tarnished. He was unwilling to accept that consequence, and his dishonesty cost depositors and investors over &dollar;1 billion. The only person who derived any benefit from his dishonesty was himself.</p>
						<p>One common manifestation of dishonesty is an unwillingness to consider all relevant information when forming opinions. This is not to say that drawing incorrect conclusions is evidence of dishonesty, but rather that the idiosyncratic exclusion of pertinent facts undermines objectivity and honesty. This frequently happens when an individuals accept their own opinions as facts. In the presence of uncertainty, it is tempting, and sometimes even necessary, to fill in blanks with assumptions, opinions and inferences. Unfortunately, it is all too easy to allow one's mind, and perhaps ego, to elevate these educated guesses to the level of truth. This behavior creates a hurdle to the acquisition of additional knowledge.</p>
						<p>A professional's pursuit of truth and knowledge must be without prejudice, and professionals must always avoid conflicts of interest that would create the incentive to report results that conflict with actual data. A prominent professor at a renowned university fell prey to this snare. Instead of examining data to ascertain whether his prior expectations were correct, he put himself in a position where he needed his expectations to be correct. As a result, he chose to manufacture data that would prove his hypothesis. A prestigious journal unknowingly published his articles and was subsequently forced to print its first ever retraction. This is a particularly egregious example, but the behavior would have been no less unbecoming if he had not manufactured data, but rather simply disregarded data that contraindicated his hypothesis.</p>
						<p>Reality, however, is too nuanced to state that honesty requires complete revelation of all facts, or even all relevant facts. A complete discussion is not reasonable here, but a few scenarios are worth identifying. For various reasons, professionals need to keep confidences. Although secrets cease to be burdens when they are no longer secret, it is not appropriate to violate another's confidence except as necessary to follow the law and protect others from harm. A second, rather common scenario addresses the popular quip, "The truth hurts." No one is permitted to offend or insult in the name of honesty. When unwelcome negative personal opinion conflicts with honesty, the solution may be an improved opinion, instead of a lie. Someone once asked, "When a child shows me a drawing, should I lie and extol it or tell the truth that it is terrible artwork and hurt the child's feelings?" It should be clear that the correct response to this question is, "What evidence beyond your own opinion have you that it is terrible? Instead of wondering whether to lie about the drawing, you could improve your attitude until you see its virtues and extol those." Honesty coupled with a positive attitude bears multiple benefits. Fewer negative opinions manifest that would otherwise need to be masked with deception, and any critical observations can be met with the trust that genuine interest for the person's welfare motivates the sentiment.</p>
						<p>Of all principles of professionalism, honesty is the most fundamental, but integrity extends beyond honest words. It is not enough to speak the truth, professionals must also be true. Honest behavior displays strict adherence to professional tenets, laws and morals. A popular old saying, "My word is my bond," describes both words and actions that are consistent and dedicated to the truth. Those who behave with such consistency can avoid needing to employ another popular but less admirable saying, "Do as I say, not as I do."</p>

						<h2>Respect</h2>
						<p>Although the AICPA has not chosen to focus on politeness and respect as professional attributes in its Code of Professional Conduct, they are definitionally a portion of professionalism and warrant a discussion here. No professional exists in a vacuum, and as a result, a key characteristic of professionals is comportment. In <i>To Sir, With Love</i>, Sidney Poitier, as inner-city school teacher Mark Thackeray, explains politeness and respect to a class of unruly teenagers:</p>
						<blockquote>
							<ul style="list-style-type: none; margin-left: 30px">
								<li>Thackeray:I realize you are not children. You will be adults in a few weeks, with all the responsibilities. From now on, you will be treated as such by me and by each other...as adults. Responsible adults. Next, we'll be reasonable with each other. We are just going to talk, you and I. You are going to listen without interruption. And when I am finished, one of you may have your say. Without interruptions. Next...</li>
								<li>Pamela:What a morning! Everything's gone wrong. First, the alarm didn't go off. Then I had to wait hours for a bus. I must have stood there three bleeding hours...</li>
								<li>Thackeray:There are two ways to enter a room. One is like an adult, a lady with dignity. The other is like a brat. Miss Dare has shown us the second way. Perhaps you'd demonstrate the first.</li>
								<li>Pamela:I'm sorry I'm late.</li>
								<li>Thackeray:Next...we are all going to observe certain courtesies in this classroom. You will call me Sir or Mr. Thackeray. The young ladies will be addressed as Miss...the boys by their surnames.</li>
								<li>Theo:Why should we call them Miss? We know them.</li>
								<li>Thackeray:I beg your pardon?</li>
								<li>Theo:I said, why should we call them Miss? We know them.</li>
								<li>Thackeray:Is there a young lady you feel...does not deserve to be addressed as Miss?</li>
								<li>Theo:No, Sir.</li>
								<li>Thackeray:Good. Next, general deportment. First, the young ladies. They must prove worthy of the courtesies we will show them. Soon, boyfriends and marriage will concern you. No man likes a slut for long. Only the worst type will marry one. And the competition for men on the outside is rough. Next, men. I've seen garbage collectors who are cleaner. Toughness is a quality of the mind...like bravery, honesty and ambition. If you want to wear your hair long, clean it...else you'll soon get lice and smell. Soon your principle interest will be girls. You will be more attractive with clean clothes, clean shoes...hands, face, teeth, et cetera. Any questions?</li>
								<li>Babs:What about Mr. Weston, Sir? He's never tidy, his shoes is never brushed, and his hair's a mess. It's filthy.</li>
								<li>Thackeray:Mr. Weston is not your teacher. We won't discuss him. I'm the one to criticize if I fail to maintain the standards.</li>
								<li>Babs:That's not fair. Sir...or Mr. Thackeray. Didn't you understand? That's not fair...Sir.</li>
								<li>Thackeray:I agree. But that's an example of things you'll have to put up with as an adult. You'll just have to take it.</li>
							</ul>
						</blockquote>
						<p>Sir addresses four aspects of comportment: speech, address, appearance and peer performance.</p>
						<p>First, professionals speak properly. They enunciate; use proper grammar; avoid slang, profanity, and filler words (e.g., "super", "really", "seriously", "like", "um", "well", "so", "y'know") and refrain from interrupting. The best tool to learn proper speech is to read well-written texts, especially classical literature&mdash;Charles Dickens's previously mentioned <em>A Christmas Carol</em> is an excellent example of worthwhile reading.</p>
						<p>Second, the correct address is always the highest. It is never appropriate to refer to an individual by first name without express permission, but the titles "Mr" and "Ms"&mdash;not "Mrs" or "Miss"&mdash;may also not be the correct choice. Academic ("Doctor" and "Professor"), commissioned military ("Ensign", "Lieutenant", "Commander", "Captain", "Major", "Colonel", "General" and "Admiral") and political ("Senator", "Congressman", "Congresswoman", "Mayor", "Governor", "Judge", "Justice", "Vice President" and "President") titles take precedence. Regardless of the correct title, "Sir" and "Madam"&mdash;or "Ma'am" when spoken&mdash;are always appropriate and can be a safe choice when the correct title is not obvious.</p>
						<p>Third, despite a societal trend towards casual dress, professionals wear the uniform of their profession. Unless otherwise specified to accommodate specific needs, that uniform is a suit, long-sleeved, button-down shirt and tie for males and a pants or skirt suit, button-down blouse and closed-toed shoes for females. Clothing should be in good repair, laundered, pressed and accompanied by a clean, well-groomed appearance.</p>
						<p>Fourth, because professionals are judged by each other, it is important to remember that no one is perfect. Everyone makes mistakes, and in the search for continual improvement, everyone falls short at some point. Peer evaluation must be the compassionate attempt to help members of the profession to improve and not an opportunity to denigrate one another. Additionally, peer performance never excuses unprofessional behavior. Someone once observed that to avoid being eaten by a bear, it was not necessary to outrun the bear, but rather to run faster than the person next to you. This advice is misguided, and it likely stems from a misinterpretation of the old poem <i>The Lion and the Gazelle</i>:</p>
						<blockquote>
							<p>Every morning in Africa, a gazelle wakes up, it knows it must outrun the fastest lion or it will be killed. Every morning in Africa, a lion wakes up. It knows it must run faster than the slowest gazelle, or it will starve. It doesn't matter whether you're the lion or a gazelle when the sun comes up, you'd better be running.</p>
						</blockquote>
						<p>The point of this poem is not that only the slowest gazelle will fail nor that being the second-slowest gazelle constitutes a success. The goal in life is not to perform as poorly as possible so long as someone else performs worse; rather, no matter the individual's circumstances, success is the virtue of the diligent. Just as the students in Sir's class could not use the failings of another teacher to excuse their lack of cleanliness, the faults of one professional will not elevate another.</p>
					</section>

					<section>
						<h2>Conclusion</h2>
						<p>Clearly this discussion of these traits has not been exhaustive, and indeed, perhaps the pursuit of professional perfection takes a lifetime. It is sufficient that the information presented here provides a necessary foundation. The responsibility to mature into a professional lies with the individual, and this maturation will require additional learning and adaptation to individual circumstances. That is the challenge. So, put on the uniform; acquire knowledge; love the truth; advance constantly.</p>
