					<div id="description">
					<h2>Course Overview</h2>
					<p>This course is an introduction to (1) the information life cycle, (2) information technology, and (3) IT controls from the perspective of an accountant.</p>
					<p>This is not a course on accounting regulations. Financial accounting, audit, and tax fill those needs. This is not a course on calculating costs and revenues. That is for management accounting. This is also not a course on small business accounting software. All of those topics are relevant and valuable, but they are not the purpose of this course. This course will teach you about enterprise-grade information systems, information technology, and cybersecurity. All accounting information comes from an information system, and as custodians of that information, it is the responsibility of accountants to understand and interact with these systems.</p>
					<p>As a result, this will feel like a technology course, instead of an accounting course. That is not by accident. Understanding how firms maintain their accounting data is not about memorizing the debits and credits of journal entries. It is about (1) knowing the steps to convert raw data into information, (2) understanding the necessary technologies, and (3) knowing how to preserve data integrity and information security.</p>
					<p>This is not an easy course. The topics we will discuss will be new to most students, and the assignments will be difficult. Again, that is not by accident. In order to open your mind to the world of information systems, you will need to jump in and get your hands dirty. You should expect to spend between five and seven hours each week on this course (in addition to class time for the live students).</p>
					<p>You may ask why this course is structured this way. Many accounting courses rely on published textbooks and publisher-provided slide presentations and exams. In the past, this course has also used those materials. It would be more convenient for me to follow this pattern, but I choose not to. Instead, I have spent countless hours creating my own slides and assignments and curating reading materials for two reasons. First, <em>your</em> future employers have demanded that we teach you skills in information technology and data analytics. Second, I want your skills in these areas to be better than anyone else's. You may not aspire to having IT skills, but this is the future of the accounting profession. Trust me; it will be worth it. You're welcome.</p>
					</div>

					<h3>Pre-requisites/Co-requisites:</h3>
					<ul>
						<li>ACCT 3110 - Intermediate Accounting I</li>
						<li>ACCT 3310 - Cost Accounting</li>
					</ul>
					<p>A solid understanding of both financial and managerial accounting are valuable for this course for two reasons. First, the practice set will test the students' understanding of financial accounting concepts. Second, in order to understand the usefulness of an information system, it is vital to understand an organization's informational needs.</p>

					<h3>Required Materials:</h3>
					<ol>
						<li><a href="http://thegnudist.github.io/accountingarchitecture" target="_blank">Course Portal</a></li>
						<li>The Open Organization</li>
						<li><a href="http://www.perdisco.com/">Practice Set</a></li>
						<li>A Computer</li>
					</ol>
					<div id="portal">
					<h4>Course Portal</h4>
					<p>The course portal provides access to all learning materials for this course. I have written the course portal to be accessible via desktop, laptop, and mobile device. The materials on the course portal are grouped by topic. Most topics will last one week; however, some topics may span multiple weeks, and some weeks may have multiple topics. The Home page of the course portal will display the topic for the current week, as well as the topic for the subsequent week. The Archive page stores all previous topics. Each topic will contain one or more of the following items:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>Lecture</li>
						<li>Readings</li>
						<li>Assignment</li>
						<li>Tutorial</li>
					</ul>
					<p><i>Lecture</i>: This course has no textbook. The decision to avoid using a textbook is primarily to save you money&mdash;you're welcome&mdash;but also because the issues we address constantly change, and a textbook would quickly be out-of-date. Instead, I have written a series of lectures that provide the foundational content for each topic. The lectures are in slide format. I have gone to great lengths to make these slides thorough and readable. The slides are not in PowerPoint format, but rather are specially designed web pages and readily viewable on any device. In order to navigate the slide deck, use the arrow keys on a keyboard or swipe horizontally on a touchscreen. The lectures are required reading, and reading the lectures should be the first activity for each new topic. </p>
					<p><i>Readings</i>: Although I have tried to write thorough lectures, I have also tried to keep the lectures concise. As a result, the lectures will never give exhaustive treatment to any topic. In order to supplement the content in these lectures, for most topics I have identified a number of online articles that either extend the principles from the lecture or give examples of real-world implementation. Some of these readings are also required, and some are simply for your personal and professional edification.</p>
					<p><i>Assignment</i>: Although knowledge of the material in the lectures and readings is important, that knowledge is not enough. The value of technology is in the ability to use it, and the only way to learn to use it is to practice. Throughout the course, I will give homework assignments designed to provide experience with enterprise-grade IT tools.</p>
					<p><i>Tutorial</i>: Lecture slides are useful for explaining topics, but they are not as useful showing technologies in action. Because several assignments involve using technologies that are new to most students, I provide video tutorials as an additional help towards completing the assignments.</p>
					As needed, I will also post news items on the course portal. These news items will be my primary method for communicating with the class&mdash;although I will use email to communicate with individual students. Because news items can come at any time, <em>all</em> students should bookmark and visit the course portal frequently (i.e., more than once each week).</p>
					</div>
					<h4>The Open Organization</h4>
					<p>A primary concept of this course is how accounting and business can shape IT. In order to gain a broad perspective of this concept, I believe it is also necessary to understand how IT shapes business. The Open Organization, written by a prominent business leader in the high tech industry, provides great insights into how IT tools, practices, and communities have created unique business models. You may purchase a copy of this book from the bookstore or online.</p>
					<h4>Practice Set</h4>
					<p>One of the required purchases for this course is an online practice set which costs &dollar;35. See <a href="#practiceset">below</a> for a description of the assignment and instructions for purchasing the practice set.</p>
					<div id="techspecs">
					<h4>Computer</h4>
					<p>All students must have access to a computer for this course. You may use a mobile device for readings and tutorials, but most assignments will require functionality that is not available on a mobile device. Desktops and laptops running any full operating system, as well as Chromebooks, are sufficient. Lab computers are available on campus for students who have no access to a computer. I <em>strongly</em> recommend that students bring a computer with them to class.</p>
					</div>

					<h3>Course Objectives:</h3>
					<p>The goal of this course is to teach:
					<ol>
						<li>The steps in the information life cycle.</li>
						<li>Common hardware and software components of an enterprise-grade information system.</li>
						<li>IT controls for data security and integrity.</li>
					</ol>
					<h3>Fogelman College: Learning Outcomes for Your Degree</h3>
					<p>This course is designed to help you to meet the overall learning objectives for the BBA in Accountancy offered by the Fogelman College. You should take the time to become familiar with these <a href="http://www.fcbeassessment.net/LearningOutcomes/BBADegreeAccountancyLearningOutcomes.pdf" target="_blank">learning objectives</a>.</p>
					<p>This course also addresses the AACSB A7 learning objective to &ldquo;develop skills and knowledge related to the <b>integration of information technology in accounting and business</b>. Included in these learning experiences is the development of skills and knowledge related to <b>data creation, data sharing, data analytics, data mining, data reporting, and storage</b> within and across organizations.&rdquo;</p>

					<h2>Grading and Evaluation Criteria</h2>
					<h3>Final Grades:</h3>
					<p>I will assign final grades according to the following scale:</p>
					<div class="table bordered">
						<div class="row header centered">
							<div class="cell">Point Range</div><div class="cell">Grade</div>
						</div>
						<div class="row centered">

						</div>
						<div class="row centered">
							<div class="cell">&lt;60</div><div class="cell">F</div>
						</div>
					</div>
					<p>I generally only give whole letter grades. However, in rare cases I will award a plus for superior and a minus for inferior effort within a grade band. I also reserve the right to curve the class upward to award students higher grades, but I will not curve downward.</p>

					<h3>Explanation of Deliverables:</h3>
					<div id="practiceset">
					<h4>Practice Set</h4>
					<p>The online practice set has been designed to provide students with practical bookkeeping experience through the completion of a one month accounting cycle for a fictional business. It is customary for accounting undergraduate students to complete a practice set, but many accounting programs use a paper system. We will use an online system because it will be easier for you and because it, in a small way, reflects the importance of information technology in accounting. This set will not require any specialized knowledge of information systems, but it will require an understanding of financial accounting principles.</p>
					<p>The practice set will provide each student with a unique accounting scenario and therefore must be completed on an individual basis. Submission is to be completed online; however it is possible to print various parts of the practice set for offline calculation. After submitting each section, the practice set will provide immediate performance feedback and a final score. Bookmarks will allow you to save your work between submissions. The practice set takes approximately 20 hours to complete.</p>

					</ol>
					<p>Payment can be made by online credit card or PayPal. Payment instructions are provided after registration.</p>
					</div>
					<div id="quizzes">
					<h4>Quizzes</h4>
					<p>In order to encourage careful reading throughout of the semester, a quiz will accompany each reading, including the syllabus and the practice set supporting documents. The online students take these quizzes through eCourseware, and the live students take these quizzes in class. I will not offer any makeup quizzes, and I will not reopen any quizzes.</p>
					</div>
					<h4>Discussions</h4>
					<p>Careful reading of the course materials is necessary for quizzes, as well as for class discussions. Discussions will extend the concepts in the reading and give the students opportunities to share their own opinions and real-world application of the concepts in the readings. For the live students, these discussions will occur in class. For the online students, I will create one or more discussion threads on eCourseware for each course topic. Each online student must post to at least one discussion thread each week. I will not provide any makeup for live discussions, and I will not reopen any online discussion threads for past topics. I will give a single grade at the end of the semester based on overall participation in discussions.</p>
					<h4>Research</h4>
					<p>Course materials, quizzes, and discussions center around content that I have curated, but I also wish to encourage independent reading and learning. Each student will complete two of the following assignments to demonstrate independent research:</p>
					<ol>
						<li>Presentation <i>(live section only)</i></li>
						<li>Report memo <i>(online section only)</i></li>
						<li>Technology report</li>
					</ol>
					<div id="presentations">
					<p><i>Presentations</i> are opportunities for students to gain experience in professional speaking. Students may choose any current technology issue for their presentations. Presentations should not discuss an issue already raised in class, but rather select a current issue that we have not already discussed. Each presentation should be approximately fifteen minutes long, and each presentation day we will have between four and five individual presentations. Each lecture day I will first ask for volunteers to present the following class period, and if any time slots remain, I will assign presenters at random. Students may choose the form of their presentations (e.g., slide deck, hands-on tutorial, video, in-class exercise, etc). Presentations will be graded according to <a href="../supplement/presentation-rubric.html" target="_blank">this rubric</a>.</p>
					</div>
					<p><i>Report memos</i> are memos that briefly explain a topic relevant to the course. Each memo should be at least 250 words in length with a proper header on a single page. I will select the memo topics, and I will assign students to each topic. I will grade memos based on accuracy of the content, grammar, spelling, and formatting.</p>
					<div id="techreport">
					<p><i>Technology reports</i> are mock reports that present research on a specific technology and explain why a firm should or should not adopt it. Reports should be at least 1,500 words in length and draw on materials beyond lecture slides and readings that I provide. Each report should have a cover page, an executive summary, page numbers (no page number on the cover page), and at least one table or figure. Although I will not require it, the best reports will include cost-benefit analysis, as well as evidence of successful implementation by another firm (i.e., case study). I will grade reports on the relevance of the topic, content (accuracy and thoroughness), grammar and spelling, and formatting and presentation. Remember, this should look like a professional report. For this assignment, students will work in groups of three or four.</p>
					</div>
					<h4>Homework</h4>
					<p>Practical experience is more valuable than simply listening to lectures. I will assign several homework assignments throughout the semester to give you the opportunity to practice what we discuss in class. Depending on the assignment, you will submit a memo, screenshot, diagram, etc., as evidence of your work. These homework assignments may require several hours of work.</p>
					<h4>Final Exam</h4>
					<p>The final exam for this course will test your knowledge of the Accounting Architecture framework. As it will be the only exam for this class, it will be comprehensive.</p>

						</div>
					</div>
					<p>The practice set will additionally have intermediate milestones to ensure that all students are on track to complete the practice set on time. I will post the deadline for these milestones on the course portal. Failure to complete a milestone will result in a 10% penalty against the overall practice set grade for each milestone missed.</p>
					<p>Homework has no predetermined schedule. I will announce homework assignments and their due dates on the course portal throughout the semester.</p>
					<h3>Final Exam Schedule:</h3>
					<p>The final exam for this class will be due on Wednesday, December 7 @ 12.00 according to the Registrar's <a href="http://www.memphis.edu/registrar/calendars/index.php" target="_blank">Academic Calendar</a>.</p>

					<h2>Course Policies</h2>
					<h3>E-Mail:</h3>
					<p>E-mail to my University of Memphis e-mail address is the best method to communicate with me, and I have provided a link to my email in the menu bar of the course portal. I will not check the e-mail functionality built into eCourseware, so I encourage you not to send any messages to me using this system. I will communicate with the students using e-mail, as well, and I will always try to respond to email within 24 hours. I will not respond to emails on Sunday. Instead, I will answer emails sent on Saturday and Sunday by Monday. I expect all students to draft professional emails with proper address, spelling, grammar, and signature block, when communicating with me, and I reserve the right not to respond to an unprofessional email.</p>

					<h3>Attendance:</h3>
					<p>For University of Memphis attendance policies including guidelines for adding or dropping classes, please reference the Undergraduate Catalog's document on <a href="http://www.memphis.edu/ugcatalog/acad_reg/attendance.php" target="_blank">Class Attendance</a>. Although I have no specific attendance requirement for this class, attendance is necessary in the live section for quizzes, discussions, and presentations. I recognize that life events can interfere with class attendance, but I encourage you to give attendance a high priority. I desire no notification of absence because I will not provide opportunities to make up points missed for absences.</p>

					<div id="integrity">
					<h3>Academic Integrity:</h3>
					<p>The University of Memphis has clear codes regarding academic and classroom misconduct. If you have any questions regarding standards for student conduct, please review the Fogelman College <a href="http://www.memphis.edu/fcbe/students/integrity.php" target="_blank">Standards for Academic Integrity</a> and the Office of Student Conduct <a href="http://www.memphis.edu/studentconduct/misconduct.htm" target="_blank">Statement of Academic and Classroom Conduct</a>. My policy is that all students should honestly submit their own work, but just as collaboration is encouraged in the work place, it is allowed in this course.</p>
					</div>

					<h3>Late Assignments:</h3>
					<p>I reserve the right to accept late assignments on a case-by-case basis. If I accept a late assignment, I will assess an appropriate grade penalty. I will not accept any late assignments after the last day of classes, and I will not accept any late submissions for the practice set or any of its milestones, quizzes, or discussions.</p>

					<h3>Extra Credit:</h3>
					<p>I believe in rewarding exceptional effort with extra credit. Throughout the semester I may give opportunities for extra credit, and for any assignment, I may, at my discretion, award extra points for exceptional submissions. I may also award extra credit to students who find and report errors, spelling or factual, in the course materials. You may contact me if you believe that your performance on a deliverable deserves extra credit. <em>However</em>, I will not accept any requests for extra credit once classes are over. Extra credit is not an opportunity to get a good grade at the last minute without having done any work during the semester, and I will not look upon that attitude favorably should I receive any such requests.</p>
