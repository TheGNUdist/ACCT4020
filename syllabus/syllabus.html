					<h2>Grading and Evaluation Criteria:</h2>
					<h3>Final Grades:</h3>
					<p>I will assign final grades according to the following scale:</p>
					<div class="table bordered">
						<div class="row header centered">
							<div class="cell">Point Range</div><div class="cell">Grade</div>
						</div>
						<div class="row centered">
							<div class="cell">&ge;90</div><div class="cell">A</div>
						</div>
						<div class="row centered">
							<div class="cell">80-89</div><div class="cell">B</div>
						</div>
						<div class="row centered">

						</div>
						<div class="row centered">
							<div class="cell">&lt;60</div><div class="cell">F</div>
						</div>
					</div>
					<p>I generally only give whole letter grades. However, in rare cases I will award a plus for superior and a minus for inferior effort within a grade band. I also reserve the right to curve the class upward to award students higher grades, but I will not curve downward.</p>

					<h3>Explanation of Deliverables:</h3>
					<div id="perdisco">
					<h4>Perdisco</h4>
					<p>The Perdisco online practice set has been designed to provide students with experience in the practical and technical skills essential to accounting through the completion of a one month accounting cycle for a fictional business. This set will not require any specialized knowledge of information systems, but it will require an understanding of financial accounting principles. When you login to your practice set, you will see a Student Companion and Helpful Hints document on your practice set home page. Please read this document because it gives you information that will help you to successfully complete the practice set. A detailed Accounting Cycle Supplement that covers the mechanics of the accounting cycle, focusing on the principles essential to preparing, analyzing and understanding financial accounting information is also included. If you have any questions regarding the correct treatment of a transaction, read the Accounting Cycle Supplement. It can answer most questions.</p>
					<p>The practice set will provide each student with a unique accounting scenario and therefore must be completed on an individual basis. Submission is to be completed online; however it is possible to print various parts of the practice set for offline calculation. After submitting each section, the practice set will provide immediate performance feedback and a final score. Bookmarks will allow you to save your work between submissions. The practice set takes approximately 20 hours to complete. The maximum number of points is 1089, but in order to accommodate errors or ambiguities in the problem set, I will grade out of 1050, meaning any score above 1050 constitutes 100% for this assignment.</p>

					</div>
					<h4>Research</h4>
					<p>The goal of this course is to encourage interest in information and technology. My lectures will introduce various topics, and you will be responsible for acquiring additional knowledge through independent readings. In order to demonstrate the additional knowledge you have acquired, you will have three assignments with the following weights:
					<ol>
						<li>15-to-20 minute presentation. (40%)</li>
						<li>Technology memos. (20%)</li>
						<li>Contribution to Accounting Architecture framework. (40%)</li>
					</ol>
					<p><i>Presentations</i> can come from one of three different sources. (1) For each week in which we will conduct student presentations, I will provide multiple presentation prompts in the lecture slides (on the final slide). Anyone who delivers a presentation based on one of these topics will receive extra credit; (2) Any self-selected issue related to the current week's lecture; or (3) Any current issue in tech news relating to Accounting Architecture. If you are choose to present on a topic of your own choosing, you should not discuss an issue already raised in class, but rather select a current issue that we have not already discussed. Each presentation day we will have between four and five individual presentations. I will first ask for volunteers for the presentation topics, and if any time slots for the following class period remain, I will assign presenters at random. You will be graded on the quality of the presentation, presentation skills, ability to respond to questions, and professionalism. Students may choose the form of their presentations (e.g., slide deck, hands-on tutorial, video, in-class exercise, etc).</p>
					<p><i><b>For the online section</b></i>: Because online students cannot make live presentations, presentations in the online section will be discussion posts. Online students create a new thread under the current week's topic and post a write-up of their presentation in lecture form. The post should be the written equivalent of a 15-to-20 minute lecture. I will identify questions that the presenter will have the responsibility to answer in subsequent posts. I will grade on content, grammar, exposition, and ability to respond to my questions.</p>
					<p><i>Technology memos</i> are one-page memos explaining and commenting on a current article in tech news. The article may come from the required or optional readings for the current week, or it may be any other current tech article online or in print media. Each student will write two memos during the semester and upload them to Dropbox in eCourseware.</p>
					<p><i>Contributions to Accounting Architecture framework</i> are revisions to the Accounting Architecture document you read during the semester. Your contribution should incorporate the research from your presentation or one of your tech memos. For this assignment, you may work alone or in groups of 2 or 3. If you work in a group, you should make one change for each member of the group to reflect each member's research. I will give a tutorial during the semester explaining how to complete this assignment. Your grade for this assignment will reflect the content and exposition of your contribution. I expect each contribution to be substantive and well-written.</p>
					<h4>Homework</h4>
					<p>Practical experience is more valuable than simply listening to lectures. I will assign several homework assignments throughout the semester to give you the opportunity to practice what we discuss in class. Depending on the assignment, you will submit a memo, screenshot, diagram, etc. as evidence of your work. These homework assignments may require several hours of work.</p>
					<p>Although bringing a computer to class is not necessary, access to a computer with a full operating system is required for some homework assignments, and bringing a computer to class will make many of these assignments easier as I will perform a walkthrough of several homework assignments during lecture.</p>
					<p><i><b>For the online section</b></i>: The online students will participate in the same homework assignments as the live section. Online students will submit their homework via a Dropbox folder on eCourseware.</p>
					<h4>Participation</h4>
					<p>Although independently acquired knowledge is important, class attendance and engagement are necessary to learn the topics in this course. I will use a combination of in-class assignments and class discussions to track attendance and measure participation. One subset of the in-class assignments will be an evaluation of the other students' presentations, and you will be required to attend all student presentations in order to receive full participation credit. Presenters will not be required to complete an evaluation of each other because presenting satisfies the participation requirement for that day.</p>
					<p><i><b>For the online section</b></i>: Each online student will complete an evaluation report for all student presentations.</p>
					<h4>Final Exam</h4>
					<p>The final exam for this course will test your knowledge of the Accounting Architecture framework. As it will be the only exam for this class, it will be comprehensive.</p>
					<h3>Schedule of Deliverables:</h3>
					<div class="table">
						<div class="row">
							<div class="cell">Perdisco</div><div class="cell">February 20 @ 23.59</div>
						</div>
						<div class="row">
							<div class="cell">Contribution to Accounting Architecture Framework</div><div class="cell">April 26 @ 23.59</div>
						</div>
					</div>
					<p><i>Presentations</i> have no common due date, but the general pattern for the course will be that I will lecture on Thursday, and student presentations that I assign on that day will be for the following Tuesday.</p>
					<p><i><b>For the online section</b></i>: Online students have until end of business on Friday to volunteer for presentations; on Saturday I will assign the remaining presentations; and presentations will be due the following Wednesday @ 23.59. The remaining online students must read the presentation and complete an evaluation by 23.59 two days later. I will also select questions for the presenter, and the presenter will have until 23.59 on the day the feedback is due to respond to them. For example, if the presentation is due on Wednesday, then I will post questions on Thursday; evaluations will be due on Friday, and the responses from the presenter are also due on Friday.</p>
					<p><i>Homework</i> also has no predetermined schedule. I will identify homework assignments and their due dates in the lecture materials throughout the semester.</p>
					<h3>Final Exam Schedule:</h3>
					<p>The final exam for this class will be due on May 5 @ 12.30 according to the Registrar's <a href="http://www.memphis.edu/registrar/calendars/index.php" target="_blank">Academic Calendar</a>.</p>

					<h2>Course Policies:</h2>
					<h3>E-Mail:</h3>
					<p>E-mail to my University of Memphis e-mail address is the best method to communicate with me, and I have provided a link to my email in the menu bar of the course portal. I will not check the e-mail functionality built into eCourseware, so I encourage you not to send any messages to me using this system. I will communicate with the students using e-mail, as well, and I will always try to respond to email within 24 hours. I will not respond to emails on Sunday. Instead, I will answer emails sent on Saturday and Sunday by Monday.</p>
					<h3>Attendance:</h3>
					<p>For University of Memphis attendance policies including guidelines for adding or dropping classes, please reference the Undergraduate Catalog's document on <a href="http://www.memphis.edu/ugcatalog/acad_reg/attendance.php" target="_blank">Class Attendance</a>. Although I have no specific attendance requirement for this class, participation is a part of the final grade, and attendance in live section or active engagement in the online section is paramount. I recognize that life events can interfere with class attendance, but I encourage you to give attendance a high priority. I require no notification of absence, but an absence on the day you are scheduled to present or on the day of the final exam will affect your grade.</p>
					<div id="integrity">
					<h3>Academic Integrity:</h3>
					<p>The University of Memphis has clear codes regarding academic and classroom misconduct. If you have any questions regarding standards for student conduct, please review the Fogelman College <a href="http://www.memphis.edu/fcbe/students/integrity.php" target="_blank">Standards for Academic Integrity</a> and the Office of Student Conduct <a href="http://www.memphis.edu/studentconduct/misconduct.htm" target="_blank">Statement of Academic and Classroom Conduct</a>. My policy is that all students should honestly submit their own work, but just as collaboration is encouraged in the work place, it is allowed in this course.</p>
					</div>
					<h3>Late Assignments:</h3>
					<p>I reserve the right to accept late assignments on a case-by-case basis. If I accept a late assignment, I will assess an appropriate grade penalty.</p>
					<h3>Extra Credit:</h3>
					<p>I believe in rewarding exceptional effort with extra credit. Throughout the semester I will give opportunities for extra credit, and for each assignment, I may, at my discretion, award extra points for exceptional submissions. Presentation topics worth extra credit are assigned on a first-come, first-serve basis.</p>
					<p>You may contact me if you wish to earn extra credit or if you believe that your performance on a deliverable deserves extra credit. <em>However</em>, I will not accept any requests for extra credit once classes are over. Extra credit is not an opportunity to get a good grade at the last minute without having done any work during the semester, and I will not look upon that attitude favorably should I receive any such requests.</p>
