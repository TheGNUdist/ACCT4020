      <h2>Architecture Framework</h2>
      <div class="flex-row">
        <div class="flex-item override"><img src="../images/arch.png" alt="Accounting Architecture Model" style="max-width: 300px"/></div>
        <div class="flex-item" style="max-width: 70%">
      <p>Understanding information systems begins with a framework that summarizes and explains the objectives, inputs, outputs, and makeup of an information system. The arch displayed here provides a graphical representation of the components of an information system. The arch comprises four sections: <strong>Environment</strong>, <strong>Information</strong>, <strong>Technology</strong>, and <strong>Control</strong>.</p>
        </div>
      </div>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Environment</h2>
      <p>The <u><em>Environment</em></u> is the collection of external and internal forces that affect the business entity and its accounting information:</p>
      <ol>
        <li><u><em>Compliance</em></u></li>
        <li><u><em>Business Model</em></u></li>
        <li><u><em>Risk</em></u></li>
      </ol>
      <p>These environmental constructs determine the boundaries of a useful information system, like a foundation sets the boundaries for a house. The environment sets the requirements for the information system, and the other sections of the arch demonstrate the design of a system that meets those requirements.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Compliance</h2>
      <p><u><em>Compliance</em></u> deals with the entity's regulatory environment. Any useful information system must generate information necessary to comply with federal, state, and local laws.</p>
      <p>Compliance also addresses contractual relationships with lenders, suppliers, and customers. Although these are not regulatory bodies, they may demand access to certain information or the implementation of certain controls. Satisfying contractual requirements can be as important as satisfying regulatory requirements in order to avoid legal liability, fines, and lost business.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Business Model</h2>
      <p>The <u><em>business model</em></u> is the form the business entity takes to achieve its long-term strategies. This can include the chosen industry to operate in, ownership structure, financing method, investments, etc. The business model also comprises a collection of <u><em>business processes</em></u> that the entity uses to accomplish vital activities, such as purchasing assets from vendors, providing goods and services to customers, or paying employees. These business processes trigger economic events that generate business data. Information systems allow for collecting, analyzing, and visualizing this data in order to generate information for decision makers.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Risk</h2>
      <p>Any business environment contains both <u><em>internal</em></u> and <u><em>external risks</em></u>. External risks include general economic conditions, industry competition and developments, availability of financing and financing requirements, litigation, technological developments, and digital threats (e.g., cyber incidents). Internal risks include business expansion, management ability and core competencies, corporate governance and culture, changes in key personnel, resource capacity, fraud, data loss and error, and technological feasibility of business and IT objectives. These risks influence the types of data that the information system should collect and analyze and, more importantly, also the set of controls the business entity should implement to avoid risks.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>What's Best for Business</h2>
      <p>Data breaches are bad for business. According to <a href="http://www.gemalto.com/brochures-site/download-site/Documents/Identity/ent-Breach_Level_Index_Annual_Report_2015.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener" aria-label="PDF opens in new window">one report</a>, in 2015 over 700 million records were breached in nearly 1,700 cyber incidents. That equates to 22 records leaked every second. 62% of cyber incidents were initiated by outsiders, 14% were initiated by malicious insiders (i.e., fraud), and 24% were accidental (i.e., error). <a href="https://www.experian.com/assets/data-breach/white-papers/2015-industry-forecast-experian.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener" aria-label="PDF opens in new window">Experian</a> predicts that insider fraud and error will continue to be a significant contributor to data leaks. In 2014, US companies reported $40 billion in losses stemming from breaches caused by employees. Currently, companies lose billions of dollars more because of externally initiated cyber incidents, and by 2020, data breach costs may have reached as high as $2 trillion worldwide.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Information</h2>
      <p>The <u><em>Information</em></u> section of the arch comprises three blocks:</p>
      <ol>
        <li><u><em>Creation</em></u>: data collection or acquisition and entry into the system.</li>
        <li><u><em>Use</em></u>: data analysis and visualization.</li>
        <li><u><em>Maintenance</em></u>: data storage and preservation.</li>
      </ol>
      <p>Each of these three blocks contains multiple steps. Together they form the information life cycle, which dictates what an information system should do to convert data into information. Although <u><em>Use</em></u> is the culminating block of both the Information section and the architecture model as a whole, knowledge of data analysis tools is incomplete without an understanding of the data and the process by which it becomes information.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Technology</h2>
      <p>The <u><em>Technology</em></u> section comprises four blocks:</p>
      <ol>
        <li><u><em>Hardware</em></u>: physical components of the information system.</li>
        <li><u><em>Software</em></u>: operating systems and applications.</li>
        <li><u><em>Storage</em></u>: physical and logical data stores.</li>
        <li><u><em>Services</em></u>: networking and cloud computing.</li>
      </ol>
      <p>The Technology blocks represent the physical manifestation of the information system (i.e., what the information system should be). Without these technologies, the information system cannot do anything; without an understanding of these technologies, no one cannot ensure that the &ldquo;black box&rdquo; of the information system will collect necessary data and generate necessary information.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Solutions &ne; Tools</h2>
      <p>When selecting technologies to integrate into an information system, it is popular to ask, &ldquo;How can I achieve solution X with tool Y?&rdquo; (e.g., How can I track sales [X] in Microsoft Access [Y]?) However, this attitude leads to an overly restrictive view of possible solutions to business problems, especially in situations when individuals have familiarity with only a small set of tools (e.g., Y always equals Microsoft Excel). This phenomenon is known as the Law of the Instrument: If all you have is a hammer, every problem looks like a nail. Posing this question in multiple parts&mdash;&ldquo;How can I achieve solution X?&rdquo; and &ldquo;Which tool(s) can best help me to achieve solution X?&rdquo;&mdash;redirects attention away from tools and toward solutions. Because the solution is the actual goal, focusing on solutions instead of tools can result in superior business outcomes.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>What About Tools?</h2>
      <p>Even when focusing on solutions, an information system must, in the end, comprise specific technological tools, and the users of the information system must understand those tools in order to derive value from them. However, an information system requires more than just the right &ldquo;apps&rdquo;. Necessary architecture tools include servers, operating systems, databases, etc.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Control</h2>
      <p>The <u><em>Control</em></u> section also comprises four blocks:</p>
      <ol>
        <li><u><em>Security</em></u>: protecting against unauthorized access.</li>
        <li><u><em>Confidentiality & Privacy</em></u>: safeguarding personal and corporate secrets.</li>
        <li><u><em>Availability</em></u>: preventing data loss and system downtime.</li>
        <li><u><em>Processing Integrity</em></u>: preventing data errors.</li>
      </ol>
      <p>With the rise in cybersecurity threats, the need to safeguard data has become increasingly important, and a control framework teaches accountants how to safeguard data. These four blocks are the <u><em>AICPA Trust Services Criteria</em></u> (TSC).</p>

      <h2>Not IT!</h2>
      <p>Knowledge of this architecture empowers individuals to collaborate with other IT staff to evaluate and use information systems that will provide the best possible information for decision makers. The goal is to &ldquo;bridge the gap&rdquo; between subject-matter experts and IT specialists. Some have called this practice &ldquo;business-led IT&rdquo;.</p>
      <blockquote class="print-centered" style="font-size: 30px">IT needs to find individuals who can work effectively with business teams to drive value to the enterprise. &ndash; Chris Bedi, CIO, ServiceNow</blockquote>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>DevOps</h2>
      <p>Collaboration between IT and business specialists is vital because companies increasingly develop their information systems in house and need business expertise to know what data to collect and which information to visualize. This collaborative effort is often called &ldquo;<em><u>DevOps</u></em>,&rdquo; from the words <em><u>development</u></em> and <em><u>operations</u></em>. DevOps has some deeply technical implications for systems development, but on a high level, it serves as a reminder that cross-functional teams are the best solution for developing systems to meet stakeholders' informational needs. DevOps also highlights a number of important principles of effective IT users: <em><u>Communication matters</u></em>, <em><u>Forget &ldquo;I don't know&rdquo;</u></em>, and <em><u>Search before asking</u></em>.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Communication Matters<br>and <a href="https://opensource.com/open-organization/17/5/5-devops-laws" target="_blank" rel="noopener" aria-label="Website opens in new window">Forget &ldquo;I Don't Know&rdquo;</a></h2>
      <p>Collaboration is about communication. The ability to communicate and collaborate requires familiarity with IT tools, practices, and controls.</p>
      <p>&ldquo;I don't know&rdquo; is the verbal equivalent of admitting defeat. Every task is an opportunity (1) to seek out new knowledge, (2) to improve, and (3) to prove that we can enable the team to go further. Our thirst for knowledge should be unquenchable. We might not know it today, but we can know it tomorrow.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2><a href="https://opensource.com/open-organization/17/5/5-devops-laws" target="_blank" rel="noopener" aria-label="Website opens in new window">Search Before Asking</a></h2>
      <p>It is important not to ask how something works without reading its documentation first. Time is precious. Asking before reading wastes the time of those answering the question; it also wastes the time of the documentation writer who toiled to make the answer available in the first place. A popular response to questions with documented answers is &ldquo;RTM&rdquo; or &ldquo;Read the Manual.&rdquo;</p>
      <p>Remember, the solutions to problems will not fall out of the sky. Solving new problems requires searching for new answers. We live in an amazing time; solutions to complex problems are at our fingertips. We just need to go and look for them. The most valuable employees will be those who are the best at finding answers.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Final Thought</h2>
      <blockquote class="print-centered">We're always looking for people who can have both a deep technology conversation, as well as a deep business conversation. You need the right blend of those people in your organization. But we also can't forget that technology is hard, and people who are very skilled at technology don't always have an interest in business processes. Having that right mix&mdash;and respecting them both appropriately&mdash;is a responsibility of the CIO and his team.<br> &ndash; Keith Collins, CIO, SAS</blockquote>
