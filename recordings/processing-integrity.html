          <p>Processing Integrity is the final block in the Control section. This block addresses the &ldquo;Garbage In; Garbage Out&rdquo; principle, which states that bad data will result in bad information. It is not sufficient for a system to be up and running, it must be able to preserve the data through the entire information or Big Data life cycle. Otherwise, users will either learn nothing from the data or worse, be misled by it.</p>

          <blockquote>System processing is complete, valid, accurate, timely and authorized.</blockquote>
          <p>The goal of every information system is to convert raw data into useful information by avoiding errors:</p>
          <ul>
            <li><u><em>Data validation</em></u> and <u><em>transaction processing</em></u> minimize data errors.</li>
            <li><u><em>Refreshing</em></u> ensures that analyzed data is up-to-date.</li>
            <li><u><em>Normalization</em></u> maintains the integrity of database records.</li>
          </ul>
        </div>
      </div>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Data Entry</h2>
      <p>Human intervention can always result in errors. <u><em>Data validation</em></u> minimizes the possibility of data entry errors with multiple checks:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><u><em>Data type check</em></u> verifies that content has the correct data type.</li>
        <li><u><em>Check digits</em></u> determine that a string of digits follows allowable algorithms (e.g., credit cards, ISBN).</li>
        <li><u><em>Presence check</em></u> looks for missing values in a record.</li>
        <li><u><em>Range check</em></u> confirms that a value is between a predetermined minimum and maximum.</li>
        <li><u><em>Uniqueness check</em></u> ensures that unique values are not duplicated (e.g., usernames).</li>
        <li><u><em>Look-up check</em></u> limits selection to pre-existing values (e.g., states in the US).</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Data Processing</h2>
      <p>These validations are useful in preventing human error in data entry, but additional errors can arise during data processing. In batch processing, controls must ensure that each record in the batch is processed. One tool to confirm the completeness of the batch is a <u><em>hash total</em></u>. A hash total is the total of one or more fields in the processed records, often a numerical field not normally used in calculations, such as the sum of all account numbers or sales order numbers or employee SSNs. By calculating the hash before processing the batch and comparing to the same hash afterwards, it is possible to conclude whether any records were not processed correctly.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Transactions</h2>
      <p>An additional tool to confirm that data was processed correctly is <u><em>transaction processing</em></u>. Although this term is frequently used to mean the processing of financial transactions, it has a specific meaning in IT. A transaction is a set of changes to be made to a database (e.g., creating a new sales order <em>and</em> reducing inventory levels <em>and</em> increasing cash receipts), and transaction processing is a control that ensures that either all changes in a transaction occur successfully or the changes are rolled back (i.e., none of the changes occur). One of the biggest benefits of RDBMSs and drawbacks of NoSQL is that RDBMSs satisfy the requirements of transaction processing, whereas NoSQL databases are generally not transactional. Because of the importance of this control, NoSQL databases have begun to implement this characteristic.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>ACID</h2>
      <p>In order for a database to be transactional, it must satisfy ACID:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><u><em>Atomicity</em></u>: all changes happen or none happen. Atomic transactions contain a clearly identifiable set of database changes, such that no change belongs to more than one transaction.</li>
        <li><u><em>Consistency</em></u>: all actions as a group violate none of the database constraints. Database constraints can include requiring NOT NULL (i.e., non-missing) values for certain fields or restricting the values of foreign keys to be existing primary key values.</li>
        <li><u><em>Isolation</em></u>: each transaction is treated as occurring before or after, not during, any others. This provides a clear order of database changes.</li>
        <li><u><em>Durability</em></u>: each committed transaction's changes are permanent.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Refreshing</h2>
      <p>When data analytics rely on data warehouses, data refreshing is vital. Because the data warehouse stores a copy of the data from online transaction processing (OLTP) systems or pre-calculated OLAP cubes, the data in the warehouse immediately becomes outdated. Regularly scheduled refreshing processes to move backups of OLTP data through staging to the data warehouse, as well as regularly scheduled recalculation of OLAP statistics, are necessary to keep analyzed data up to date. When OLTP systems are also used for analytics, data is inherently up to date.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Bad Repetition</h2>
      <p>Although redundancies promote availability by removing single points of failure, not all redundancies are good. The benefits of a relational database require an <em>avoidance</em> of data redundancy within a database. In fact, one of the reasons to transition from a flat file database or a file system to a relational database is to avoid data redundancies that can arise when storing all database data in a single unstructured table or when storing data across multiple files in a file system, especially when these files are maintained by different users. However, redundancies can also arise in database systems through the creation of <u><em>functional dependencies</em></u>. Functional dependencies are either <u><em>partial</em></u> or <u><em>transitive</em></u>.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Partial Dependencies</h2>
      <p>A <u><em>partial dependency</em></u> arises if a non-key attribute (i.e., an attribute that is not a primary key) depends on only part of a composite key (i.e., a primary key that comprises multiple attributes). For example, in a course schedule, the composite key Semester, Year, Course, and Section identifies a unique record. Frequently, a course schedule would also include the attribute Course Name, but because the name rarely changes from one semester to the next, Course Name depends exclusively on Course, which is only part of the composite key.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Transitive Dependencies</h2>
      <p>A <u><em>transitive dependency</em></u> arises when a non-key attribute is dependent on another non-key attribute. For example, the entity Employee might include Employee ID, Employee Name, Department ID, and Department Name. Employee ID is the primary key, and the employee's department (Department ID) depends on Employee ID. However, Department Name depends on Department ID, which is not a primary key. This is a transitive dependency because Employee ID &rarr; Department ID &rarr; Department Name, which creates a transitive link between Employee ID and Department Name.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Repeating Groups</h2>
      <p>Both partial and transitive dependencies create <u><em>repeating groups</em></u>. The values in the field or fields that rely on only part of a composite key in a partial dependency are unnecessarily repeated each time that part of the offending attribute in the composite key repeats. The existence of a composite key is evidence that the individual attributes repeat, and making another attribute dependent on it forces that attribute also to repeat. Similarly, in a transitive dependency, any non-key attribute can, and likely will, repeat in a database table. Any attribute that is dependent on a repeating attribute will also repeat. Partial and transitive dependencies are effectively equivalent; they only differ by whether the offending attribute is part of a key or not. The redundancies from these dependencies cause <u><em>create</em></u>, <u><em>update</em></u>, and <u><em>delete anomalies</em></u>.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Create Anomaly</h2>
      <p>The <u><em>create anomaly</em></u> arises when it is not possible to add a record to a table because the new record has no value for the primary key. Both functional dependencies cause this anomaly if a user only wishes to add data for an attribute and its dependent part of a composite key or non-key attribute. For example, suppose an Inventory table with SKU as primary key includes the name, address, and contact info for the vendor. The company wishes to add an approved vendor to the vendor list, but the company has not yet identified which items to order from that vendor. It is not possible to add that vendor to the database because no value for the primary key SKU exists.</p>

    <section>
      <h2>Update Anomaly</h2>
      <p>Repeating groups are especially problematic for the <u><em>update anomaly</em></u>. Relational databases centralize data, and repeating groups decentralize data across database records. If a user needs to update a value in a database, repeating groups force the user to update that value more than once. This creates a risk of having inconsistent data across records if the user fails to update all instances of the data. For example, if an Inventory table includes vendor contact info, and the vendor carries more than one inventory item, and the contact information for the vendor changes, it is necessary to find all references to that vendor in the table and update each separately.</p>

      <h2>Delete Anomaly</h2>
      <p>The <u><em>delete anomaly</em></u> is the loss of unintended information when a record is removed. Dependencies seemingly avoid this anomaly by creating redundancy, but they also cause it by allowing data that relates to multiple keys to be treated as if it related to a single key. When that key is deleted, the data is also unnecessarily deleted. If an Inventory table includes vendor contact info, and the company decides to discontinue the only item carried by that vendor, deleting the inventory record will also delete the vendor contact info. Any attempt to undo this error and reenter the vendor data would result in a create anomaly.</p>

      <h2>Fixing Dependencies</h2>
      <p>The ability to fix dependencies is inherent to the relational aspect of a relational database. Unlike a flat file database that groups all data together, a single relational database can have multiple tables, and primary and foreign keys can create relationships between those tables in order to link the data in one table with the data in another without storing them together and creating anomalies.</p>
      <p><u><em>Normalization</em></u> removes functional dependencies and their resulting anomalies by dividing tables with dependencies into multiple tables connected by foreign keys. Second normal form (2NF) removes partial dependencies, and third normal form (3NF) additionally removes transitive dependencies. Third normal form is the minimum standard for a well-defined database.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Only Grouches Love Trash</h2>
      <p>Because decision makers rely on the information extracted from data, they implicitly rely on the quality of the data, and the principle of &ldquo;garbage in, garbage out&rdquo; applies. A system may function without error prevention, but uncontrolled data leads to uncontrolled inferences and uncontrolled business decisions. Proper data entry and processing tools, up-to-date data for analysis and well-designed relational databases help to ensure clean data, good information, and correct inferences.</p>
