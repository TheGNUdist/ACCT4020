          <p>The Software block of the architecture framework is the most multi-faceted block of the Technology section. This block covers multiple topics related to software and software development. The first of these is open source. Though not exclusively a software issue, open source and open content, more generally, have completely reshaped the computing world. Understanding software begins with understanding what open source is.</p>

      <h2>Proprietary Is Licensed</h2>
      <p>The creator of intellectual property automatically has all rights to that creation. As a result, a tool is necessary to award third parties certain rights so that creator retains ownership while letting others benefit from the creation. A <u><em>license</em></u> serves this purpose. It allows the owner of intellectual property to grant privileges to others without giving up ownership.</p>
      <p>(This is the legal text that no one reads but everyone agrees to when installing software, signing up for an online service, etc.)</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Proprietary is Closed</h2>
      <p>Licensing encourages invention by protecting the inventor. Licenses let users view movies and shows, listen to music, read books, install software, etc., while ensuring that the creator retains ownership. However, a side-effect of proprietary licenses is the formation of black boxes. No one can investigate the creation, make changes to it, or share the creation with others. Proprietary licenses create <u><em>closed content</em></u>.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Open is Open</h2>
      <p>The premise of <u><em>open content</em></u> is that the creator of intellectual property makes the creation <em><u>freely available</u></em> for others to <u><em>view</em></u>, <u><em>inspect</em></u>, <u><em>modify</em></u>, <u><em>reuse</em></u>, and <u><em>redistribute</em></u>. The Modern Paradigm for Standards identifies the following benefits of open content:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><u><em>Interoperability</em></u>: the ability of a product, system, or practice to work with other products, systems, or practices.</li>
        <li><u><em>Transparency</em></u>: the subjection of a creation or process to public scrutiny.</li>
        <li><u><em>Innovation</em></u>: the facilitation of the creation of new ideas.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Open content encourages invention and innovation by making knowledge about prior inventions more widely accessible.</p>
    </section>

      <h2>Many Types of Closed and Open</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><u><em>Access</em></u>: the availability of creative works</li>
        <li><u><em>Standard</em></u>: a set of specifications, units, or practices</li>
        <li><u><em>Format</em></u>: a standard for storage of digital media</li>
        <li><u><em>System</em></u>: interconnected hardware and software components</li>
        <li><u><em>Design</em></u>: hardware or software schematics</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Open Access</h2>
      <p>Of the types of open content, open access may be the easiest to comprehend. Closed access requires a user to pay in order to use creative works (e.g., music, videos, books, articles) and prohibits any sharing or modification of the created work. Film and record studios reinforce this point when denouncing piracy.</p>
      <p>Open access gives users free access to use and reuse creative works. Free use of creative works means not needing to pay royalties for accessing, reading, viewing, or listening to content. Free reuse means being able to share the content with others, as well as make changes to the content and share the changes with others.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Creative Commons</h2>
      <p><u><em>Creative Commons</em></u> is a series of open access licenses for creative works with a combination conditions:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><u><em>Attribution</em></u> (BY) requires identifying the original creator in any reuse.</li>
        <li><u><em>Share-alike</em></u> (SA) forces the license of derivative works to be the same as the original.</li>
        <li><u><em>Non-commercial</em></u> (NC) prevents the use or reuse of the work for commercial purposes (i.e., for profit).</li>
        <li><u><em>No Derivative Works</em></u> (ND) allows only verbatim copies.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>The more conditions a CC license includes, the stricter it becomes. A CC license with no conditions (CC0) is the same as placing a work in the <u><em>public domain</em></u>.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Public Domain</h2>
      <p>Unlike an open access license, which allows the creator to stipulate how a creative work can be reused, placing a creation in the public domain strips the creator of any rights to the work. This decision may be appropriate when the creator no longer has any interest in the work or when the creator is already dead&mdash;many classical works are in the public domain, although modern performances of classical works are not&mdash;but it is less appropriate when the creator wants to share while retaining ownership and control. Open access licenses mimic the public domain by making the work freely available, and they mimic closed content by giving the creator final say over what is and is not allowed.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>What Is a Standard?</h2>
      <p>A standard is a set of specifications, units, or practices. The goal of a standard is to identify common parameters and definitions in order to facilitate compatibility and interoperability between implementations. Popular computer hardware standards include HDMI, Bluetooth, USB, and SATA. One poignant benefit of hardware standards is freedom from vendor lock-in. It is not necessary to purchase a USB-powered mobile device and charging cable from the same manufacturer because other manufacturers have access to the same USB standard and can readily provide compatible charging cables.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Open Standards</h2>
      <p>Not all standards are open standards. Although no single definition of an open standard exists, the Modern Paradigm for Standards is a widely accepted definition. It comprises five principles of open standards:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Respectful <u><em>cooperation</em></u> between standards organizations.</li>
        <li><u><em>Adherence to principles</em></u> of standards development, including due process, broad consensus, transparency, balance, and openness.</li>
        <li>Commitment to <u><em>collective empowerment</em></u> by promoting meritocracy, interoperability, competition, innovation, and humanity.</li>
        <li><u><em>Availability</em></u> of standards for implementation on a royalty-free or fair, reasonable, and non-discriminatory basis.</li>
        <li><u><em>Voluntary adoption</em></u> of standards.</li>
      </ol>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Open Formats</h2>
      <p>A format, or file format, is a type of standard that applies to the storage of digital media. These formats are often colloquially referred to as file extensions. Common examples include DOCX, XLSX, PPTX, HTML, JPG, MP3, TXT, etc. Just as with any other standard, the purpose of a file format is to promote compatibility and interoperability. Without standardization, it would not be possible to share data between users or devices.</p>
      <p>Open formats adhere to the principles of open standards. Perhaps the most important open standard principle for open formats is availability. Many closed formats are kept secret so that only the software provided by the creator can read and write the format. Others are only made available with large royalty payments.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>A Big Deal</h2>
      <p>Perhaps the most monumental example of the benefits of open standards is the World Wide Web, which is the global collection of documents and other resources accessed by a global system of interconnected networks called the Internet. Sir Tim Berners-Lee invented the World Wide Web in 1989. The standards for creating, storing, sharing, and accessing Web content are all open standards governed by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C). It is easy to contribute additional content to the World Wide Web because commonly used file formats, such as HTML and CSS, are open, and it is easy to access Web content because the World Wide Web itself is available royalty free, even though some of the content is not. It is almost certain that if the Web relied on closed standards, it would not have grown to its current omnipresent level.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Open Systems</h2>
      <p>Open systems are a common example of interoperability, and they also serve to prevent vendor lock-in. A system is connected hardware and software, and an open system accepts a wider variety of hardware and software than a closed system. Many workstations are open systems. The motherboard can be from one vendor, the memory and CPU from another, and the storage drive from another, according to the user's preferences. In a closed system, the vendor selects all components, even though they may originally come from different manufacturers or developers. Many laptops and mobile devices are closed hardware systems. iOS is an example of a closed software system. Apple controls what software is available for iOS.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Open Design</h2>
      <p>Open design governs the availability of hardware schematics and source code. Source code is a collection of computer instructions written in a specific human-readable programming language that create a software application. Open design source code is known as <u><em>open source software</em></u> (OSS) or free and open source software (FOSS). Open design software is much more prevalent than open design hardware because hardware schematics merely allow a user with the requisite materials to replicate a hardware device, whereas open source software provides the user with the actual application, not simply the instructions to create it.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Sharing Software</h2>
      <p>When computers were still new, software was mostly developed by universities, and the source code was released into the public domain. Because computer hardware was not standardized, software was only compatible with a single computer, and users needed to modify the source code for their specific hardware. Because users had the source code, they could also fix bugs (i.e., errors in the code) and add functionality to the software. By the 1960s, software became more complicated, complex, and expensive to develop, and developers began wanting to earn royalties for their intellectual property. At first, developers protected their source code with paid licenses which restricted users' ability to make modifications or share the source code with others.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Binary Code</h2>
      <p>The second step in protecting licensed software assets was restricting users' access to the source code. Because source code is human-readable, users can read the code and modify or duplicate the functionality. In order to keep the underlying code a trade secret, developers began to sell software licenses that only included executables or binary code. Unlike source code, binary code is only computer-readable, and it cannot be modified by the user.</p>
      <p>Licenses that restrict sharing, modification, and access to source code discourage innovation because the creator becomes the only party who can fix and improve the original software. Users are completely dependent on the vendor to maintain and update the software.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>The Free Software Movement</h2>
      <p>In order to combat the power of software vendors and recreate the earlier environment of shared software, Richard Stallman established the Free Software Foundation (FSF) to support the development of software in which the source code was freely shared. His primary motivation for this movement was an experience he had in 1979. At the time, Stallman worked for MIT, and his department had a Xerox laser printer that would jam. The programmers in the department could have written software that would report a jam, but they had no access to the printer's source code. One academic at another university had received a copy of the source code from Xerox but was under a non-disclosure agreement not to share it.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Four Freedoms</h2>
      <p>Richard Stallman founded the FSF because he believed that limiting users' ability to read and modify source code was morally reprehensible. He envisioned four essential software freedoms:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>The freedom to run the program as you wish, for any purpose (freedom 0)</li>
        <li>The freedom to study how the program works, and change it so it does your computing as you wish (freedom 1)</li>
        <li>The freedom to redistribute copies so you can help your neighbor (freedom 2)</li>
        <li>The freedom to distribute copies of your modified versions to others (freedom 3)</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Still a License</h2>
      <p>In 1989, Richard Stallman introduced the GNU General Public License (GPL) for releasing software that adheres to these four freedoms. Unlike traditional software licenses that preserved copyright, the GPL preserves <u><em>copyleft</em></u>. Copyleft is the most extreme form of openness for software. It requires that the original creation, as well as all subsequent modifications, satisfy the four freedoms. As a result, Richard Stallman labels software that uses the GPL license <u><em>free software</em></u>.</p>
      <p>GPL serves a similar role for software as Creative Commons licenses serve for creative works. However, not all CC conditions are compatible with copyleft or Stallman's four freedoms. SA is the most similar to GPL, whereas NC and ND violate freedoms 1 and 3.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Open Source Software</h2>
      <p>Other groups have proposed alternative definitions of openness and introduced additional licenses consistent with these definitions. The most prominent example is the Open Source Initiative (OSI) founded by Eric Raymond. This group coined the term &ldquo;open source software,&rdquo; which has become a much more widely used term than free software. Two popular OSI-approved open source licenses are the BSD license and the MIT license. Unlike the restrictive GPL license, which requires that all modifications satisfy the same four freedoms as the original software, these permissive licenses give the user the ability to release modifications as closed source (i.e., proprietary software).</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Gratis versus Libre</h2>
      <p>One of the reasons why the term &ldquo;open source software&rdquo; is more popular than &ldquo;free software&rdquo; is that free is ambiguous. Richard Stallman means free as in freedom (libre: with little or no restriction), not free as in beer (gratis: for zero price). Free and open source software provides the freedom to inspect, modify, reuse, redistribute, etc. Although the creators of free and open source software frequently also make their software available at no cost, this is not a requirement in order for the content to qualify as open. In fact, Richard Stallman charged a fee for the first free software he developed, but he made the source code available for the user to use and reuse, and the user was allowed to share the source code with others at whatever cost the user preferred.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Innovation</h2>
      <p>The primary benefit of open source software is innovation. This comes in two forms. First, because the source code is freely available, users can contribute patches (i.e., updates) with bug fixes or new features. This extends software development beyond the capabilities of the original creator. This is often referred to as <u><em>crowdsourcing</em></u> because it draws resources from the general population. Second, users can fork original projects to create new ones. Instead of beginning at square one, a new developer can take all or part of the source code of an existing project and begin a new project. This accelerates the availability of new software by reusing existing code.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Old Concepts</h2>
      <p>Innovation and sharing are the products of open source, but they also predate open source. They are so familiar that exercising the closed-source-level of control in other settings would be unconscionable. Cookbooks are an excellent example of this principle. Publishers charge for cookbooks, and copyright protects them from readers duplicating their recipes and reselling them, but they cannot prevent readers from sharing individual recipes or modifying the recipes and sharing their modifications. A significant amount of innovation in cooking occurs by modifying others' recipes. Sharing and modifying what we learn is central to any skill. Open source simply formalizes this for software development.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Taking Advantage</h2>
      <p>Permissive licenses, such as the BSD license, have allowed many proprietary software products to incorporate open source software tools. The network tools in Microsoft Windows were originally released under the BSD license; the macOS operating system itself is released under the BSD license. The core of the Google Chrome browser, which is not open source, is Chromium, a web browser released under BSD and MIT licenses. This development model is called &ldquo;open core&rdquo; and involves creating closed source software from open source components. This is one example of the potential for innovation that open source software provides.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Where Is Open Source?</h2>
      <p>Because of the ability to use and reuse open source software, it has become a valuable tool in corporate information systems. As companies have begun to recognize the value of specialized systems that can collect and analyze specialized information, traditional, off-the-shelf, closed source software has become less valuable because companies cannot customize it to their needs. However, companies are also not interested in developing everything that they need from scratch. Open source software provides these companies with source code that they can customize and reuse, in order to create a useful information system. As a result, 98% of companies use open source software in their information systems, and it is an important element of information technology.</p>
