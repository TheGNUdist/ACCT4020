          <p>Sound information is the goal of an information system, and the Information section of the architecture model lists the activities necessary to obtain the right data and convert it into the right information. Much of that data is traditional business data, but recently, information systems have increasingly focused on Big Data. The best information systems are flexible enough to support the creation, maintenance, and use of both types of data for the benefit of internal and external decision makers.</p>

      <h2>ILC</h2>
      <p>The information sciences discipline has developed the <u><em>information life cycle</em></u> (ILC). The ILC explains how to know what data to collect, how to collect it, how to use it to create information, and what to do with the data after it has outlived its usefulness.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>How Did We Get Here?</h2>
      <p>In 1947, the U.S. Government formed the Government Records Management Task Force to deal with the approximately 50 billion sheets of paper (18.5 million cubic feet or six Pentagons) stored in over 100 records centers costing over $1.2 billion per year. The task force determined that 50% of these documents could be immediately eliminated and that only 4% had any obvious value. In order to prevent this situation from arising again, the head of this task force, Emmet J. Leahy, designed the first information life cycle model. This life cycle determined the ideal system for managing documents consistently, effectively, and efficiently from creation, through storage, to their ultimate destruction, which could be put in place before any document was created. This same principle guides digital information systems today.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>The Modern Information Life Cycle</h2>
      <div class="override"><img class="print-centered" src="../images/ilc.png" alt="Information Life Cycle" style="max-height: 250px"/></div>
      <p>The modern-day ILC explains what an information system should do. The ILC contains 13 steps grouped into three phases. The <u><em>Creation</em></u> phase includes the steps necessary to bring data into the information system. The <u><em>Maintenance</em></u> phase contains the steps to ensure that data is findable when needed. The <u><em>Use</em></u> phase comprises the steps to convert data into information.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>You Must Remember This...</h2>
      <p>The arrow shapes in the ILC graphic seem to imply an order of events. Although certain life cycle steps precede others, the ILC is less of a roadmap or a set of directions and more of a blueprint. This has two implications. First, the steps in the ILC may not be in the same order at all times for all types of data. Second, and more importantly, an information system should be completely designed, according to the guidelines in this blueprint, before attempting to acquire any data. The Technology section of the architecture model highlights the technologies that make up the information system, and they serve to implement the ILC. As a result, when selecting information technologies, it is important to keep in mind which tasks in the ILC the technology will help to accomplish.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Creation Phase: Needs Assessment</h2>
      <p>The first step in the ILC is the <u><em>needs assessment</em></u>. This step is first because it identifies the informational needs of internal and external stakeholders that the information system should satisfy. The understanding is necessary in order to design a useful information system. Conducting a needs assessment is very simple but vitally important:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Evaluate the current information, skills, and processes in place.</li>
        <li>Determine what information the organization requires in order to meet its objectives.</li>
        <li>Compare the results of the first two steps to demonstrate which information, skills, or processes need to be added and which can be removed.</li>
      </ol>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Which Came First?</h2>
      <p>Needs assessment is unique among the steps in the ILC because it is the only planning task. The remainder of the steps in the life cycle are the tasks in converting data into information. This can create confusion regarding the order of events. First, the needs assessment determines what information the information system should generate. Second, IT and business specialists collaborate to design a system that will successfully implement the remaining steps in the ILC to bring necessary information to decision makers. Third, the completed information system leads data through the steps in the information life cycle to generate information. Fourth, as necessary, a new needs assessment is conducted in order to discover the need for modifications to the information system.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Creation Phase: Acquisition</h2>
      <p><u><em>Acquisition</em></u> is the first step in the ILC that occurs after the design and implementation of the information system, and it is also the first step that directly affects business data. Acquisition is the act of obtaining data, either from external sources (e.g., source documents) or from previously owned data (e.g., internal reports) to enter into your system. Although this step is the first time an organization will handle a data object, it is not the point at which that object is ready to enter the information system.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Creation Phase: Classification</h2>
      <p>The first processing step prior to data entry is <u><em>classification</em></u>, which is the act of assigning descriptive attributes to a data item. These descriptive attributes are called <u><em>metadata</em></u>. Metadata is literally data about data. It is what the data, be it a single number or an entire document, means. Units are a simple example of metadata. the number 1,000 on a financial statement could be dollars, thousands of dollars, or even millions of dollars. Each of these units gives the number 1,000 a different meaning. Similarly, when measuring distances, the number 1,000 could be centimeters, feet, or miles. Each of these lengths gives the number 1,000 a different meaning that is also very different from 1,000 dollars. Units of measurement are a form of metadata that gives a number a particular meaning. Without units, the number 1,000 has no meaning.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Metadata Gives Life Meaning</h2>
      <p>The importance of metadata for lending meaning extends beyond single numbers to entire documents or files. If a radio studio had 10,000 songs with incremented file names (i.e., 0000.mp3, 0001.mp3, 0002.mp3, etc.), how would the DJ know which song to choose? Put differently, what is the meaning of 0145.mp3? Meaning in this case could be song title, artist, album, and year, but without metadata a DJ would not know that 0145.mp3 means Bohemian Rhapsody by Queen on A Night at the Opera from 1975. In order to find the track with that meaning, the DJ would need to listen to each file in order to find the correct one. In a set of 10,000 files, listening to each in order to find a specific one would make for a lousy radio station. However, with the proper metadata to give the files meaning, the DJ can always retrieve the correct song.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>More Important Than You Might Think</h2>
      <p>Sometimes we might overlook the importance of metadata because our brains seem good at describing and identifying objects in the real world. We may feel that our own senses are sufficient without the help of metadata, but what happens to a computer with no senses if objects have no metadata? What happens if someone wants to stream a video, but the video has no assigned metadata? How would the user find it? The user interface would not know how to find a video that does not have a name assigned to it. Or worse, what happens if someone wants to stream a video, but the video's metadata is wrong? The interface does not know whether the video's name is correct, only what the assigned video name is. No user wants to watch a random movie that the interface thinks is right.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>ATTRIBUTE : value</h2>
      <p>Metadata relies on pairs of <u><em>attributes</em></u> and <u><em>values</em></u>. An attribute is a characteristic of a data object. Each attribute takes on a different value for each data object. For example, a book may have the attributes title, author, year, and publisher, and a specific book would have the following attribute-value pairs:</p>
      <ul style="list-style-type: none; display: inline-block">
        <li>(ATTRIBUTE) : (value)</li>
        <li>TITLE : The Open Organization</li>
        <li>AUTHOR : Jim Whitehurst</li>
        <li>YEAR : 2015</li>
        <li>PUBLISHER : Harvard Business Review Press</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>A Question of Formatting</h2>
      <p><u><em>eXtensible Markup Language</em></u> (XML) is a popular convention for formatting metadata using tags. The &lt;tag&gt; corresponds to the attribute, and the text between the open &lt;tag&gt; and the close &lt;/tag&gt; is the value, such that XML reads &lt;attribute&gt;value&lt;/attribute&gt;. The same book listed previously would have the following XML-formatted metadata:</p>
      <ul style="list-style-type: none; display: inline-block">
        <li>&lt;metadata&gt;
          <ul style="list-style-type: none">
            <li>&lt;title&gt;The Open Organization&lt;/title&gt;</li>
            <li>&lt;creator&gt;Jim Whitehurst&lt;/creator&gt;</li>
            <li>&lt;year&gt;2015&lt;/year&gt;</li>
            <li>&lt;publisher&gt;Harvard Business Review Press&lt;/publisher&gt;</li>
          </ul>
          &lt;/metadata&gt;
        </li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Creation Phase: Conversion and Ingestion</h2>
      <p><u><em>Conversion</em></u> is the transformation of data from its current format to a more desirable format for the purposes of storage. This might be done to promote uniformity or to conform the data to the technology that is already in use in the information system. Scanning a document to create a PDF is one example.</p>
      <p>The final step in the Creation phase is <u><em>ingestion</em></u>, which is when data enters the information system. Data entry can be manual or automated and <u><em>continuous</em></u> or <u><em>batch</em></u>. Continuous ingestion is a greater burden on information system resources, but it makes data available immediately. Batch ingestion uses resources more efficiently by entering data in groups (i.e., batches) when information system resources are not needed by other functions (e.g., after work hours).</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Maintenance Phase: Storage</h2>
      <p><u><em>Storage</em></u> is both the act of storing physical and digital data, as well as the method of storing that data, for future use. The principles of storage are straightforward and unchanging. One key to successful storage is choosing the appropriate medium for each data object. Considerations include the length of time the data should be stored, desired ease of access to the data, and expected future increases (i.e., scalability) in storage needs. Here again, a needs assessment will discover what medium is appropriate for which data. It is not feasible to store a horse underneath a bed, nor is it wise to store large files marked for permanent retention on cheaply made thumb drives.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>You Cannot Store Everything</h2>
      <p>Another key to successful storage is identifying what data is important enough to store in the first place. The world is full of data, and storing more than is absolutely necessary increases costs and makes necessary data less findable and usable.</p>
      <blockquote class="print-centered">There's a temptation to think that you're just going to store everything. First, that's a fool's errand because it will break the bank. Yes, storage is getting cheaper, but it's not getting cheaper as fast as we're getting more data. And second, it just doesn't make good business sense.<br>&ndash; Jeffrey Crigler, CTO, Catalist</blockquote>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Maintenance Phase: Indexing</h2>
      <p>The goal of the classification and storage steps is to make the right data retrievable when needed. <u><em>Indexing</em></u> increases findability by creating an additional data store of <u><em>keys</em></u> and <u><em>pointers</em></u>. An index is a store of metadata. The metadata attribute identifies the type of index, the metadata value is the key, and the pointer identifies the location of the data object the metadata describes. A library catalog of book titles, a keyword index in the back of a textbook, or a list of song titles in a playlist are all examples of indexes. Looking for a key in an index and then following the pointer to the data object is faster than searching through an entire data store for the desired data item. This is true when performing a manual search or an automated search with queries. Indexing can save valuable time, as well as computing resources when data is needed.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Maintenance Phase: Refreshing and Interpretation</h2>
      <p><u><em>Refreshing</em></u> updates data stores to ensure that data and metadata are current and up-to-date. Refreshing also preserves data from corruption over time by creating fresh but still identical copies of stored data.</p>
      <p><u><em>Interpretation</em></u> is the selection and preservation of hardware and software necessary to access data from digital data stores. Software and hardware frequently change, and the selection of storage technologies will not guarantee data accessibility permanently. For example, floppy discs won't fit in CD drives. Laser discs are only useful with access to a working laser disc player. Microsoft Access files require the Microsoft Access software.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Use Phase: Searching</h2>
      <p>The Use phase is the culmination of the ILC, and it is also the apex of the architecture model. It represents the goal of the entire information system: retrieving and using data to create valuable information. Effective data retrieval is the bridge between data storage and data analytics. Stored data is only useful if it is retrievable; irretrievable data may just as well not exist. Metadata is a primary requirement for data retrievability. Data retrieval and use begin with <u><em>searching</em></u> to find data in storage. Searching for data in digital storage often involves the use of <u><em>queries</em></u>, which are search commands that request data based on certain characteristics. Indexes aid in searching by linking data attributes to the data storage location.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Use Phase: Analytics</h2>
      <p><u><em>Analytics</em></u> is a popular buzzword, but it is simply the process of using data to gain insights and make informed business decisions. The terms <u><em>business intelligence</em></u> and <u><em>business analytics</em></u> or <u><em>data analytics</em></u> are used interchangeably. These newer concepts are loosely defined as the skills, tools, technologies, and techniques used to gather and understand data to make informed business decisions. In the current Information Era, the availability of larger amounts of data, as well as greater computing power needed to store, retrieve, and process that data, has made data analytics more valuable because it can answer previously unanswered, money-making questions. The best analytical tool will depend on the nature of the data and the type and urgency of the question, but in the current business climate, the ability to use at least one tool is a valuable skill.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Use Phase: Reporting</h2>
      <p>The end goal of the entire ILC is to communicate information to decision makers. As a result, even though this step in the ILC is called <u><em>reporting</em></u>, it comprises more than conventional reports. In today's environment, much reporting is immediate in the form of <u><em>dashboards</em></u> or notifications. Dashboards provide users with a collection of graphs and figures that give up-to-date business statistics. Notifications or flags bring issues to a user's attention in order to prompt immediate action.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Show Me Something</h2>
      <p>Many reports, and especially dashboards, rely on <u><em>visualization</em></u> to communicate results. Of all the human senses, vision is processed by the brain the fastest. This means that a strong visual representation can convey more information faster than any other method. In addition, the human visual faculties can be very good at distinguishing patterns and differences, an advantage that can be used when preparing reports and creating graphs, tables, or infographics, which are compilations of visual representations of data to tell a story. Because visualizations are powerful reporting tools, when using them it is important to strive for integrity. It is not difficult to manipulate graphics in order to distort or exaggerate. However, strategic planning based on inaccurate information is detrimental.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Maintenance Phase: Disposition</h2>
      <p>The end goal of the ILC is reporting, but that is not the end of the data's life cycle. Once the data has outlived its usefulness, it faces <u><em>disposition</em></u>. Disposition is not necessarily deletion. Data that belongs to another organization might be returned to the owner. Internally generated data that other organizations find valuable might be transferred or sold. Useless data and sensitive data should be deleted or destroyed. Even permanent retention of data in long-term storage is a form of disposition. The method and timing of data disposition should always follow previously established <u><em>disposition schedules</em></u>, which are an organization's guidelines for data disposition at the end of its useful life.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>What About Big Data?</h2>
      <p>The ILC explains how an information system should convert traditional business data into information. However, much data today is <u><em>Big Data</em></u>. Three characteristics distinguish Big Data from regular data. <u><em>Volume</em></u>, the reason Big Data is referred to as &ldquo;Big,&rdquo; connotes the large amounts of data businesses receive from transactions, machine communication, and social media interactions. <u><em>Velocity</em></u> references the high rate at which these large amounts of data are created and processed. <u><em>Variety</em></u> describes the lack of uniformity in data sources containing text, audio, video, image, and other data types. Each of these characteristics present challenges that require new approaches to the ILC.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Big Data Life Cycle</h2>
      <div class="override"><img class="print-centered" src="../images/bdlc.png" alt="Big Data Life Cycle" style="max-height: 250px"/></div>
      <p>The <u><em>Big Data life cycle</em></u> (BDLC) comprises the steps to convert Big Data into useful business information. Much of this life cycle is the same as the ILC. The five steps in bold italics are steps that apply only to Big Data, and they replace steps in the ILC. Steps with an asterisk share a name with an ILC step but require different execution in the BDLC to accommodate the unique nature of Big Data.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>BDLC vs. ILC: Creation Phase</h2>
      <p>When examining Big Data, a needs assessment differs from a traditional ILC needs assessment in one significant way: the volume of data makes it difficult to ascertain exactly which data items will be useful. Instead, data sources (i.e., pools) which are most likely to provide useful data are identified. Then, instead of acquiring only what is needed, <u><em>collection</em></u> involves gathering all of the data from those previously identified pools. <u><em>Sifting</em></u> is the evaluative process that follows; data that has been collected is examined and unnecessary data is deleted. This alleviates the need to process data that will only prove useless later on. Lastly, <u><em>synchronization</em></u> pairs or correlates this Big Data with existing traditional business data.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>BDLC vs. ILC: Maintenance Phase</h2>
      <p>The changes in the storage step are some of the most significant because the underlying technology is very different. Big Data's volume and variety make it ill-suited to traditional storage technologies, and a variety of creative data stores have been developed to address these issues.</p>
      <p><u><em>Pre-processing</em></u> replaces indexing as a means of transforming Big Data into more usable data that is ready for analysis. Cleaning and manipulation, which must be completed before data analysis, occur during this step. This includes removing duplicate or unnecessary data, sorting data, and grouping appropriate data together.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>BDLC vs. ILC: Use Phase</h2>
      <p><u><em>Monitoring</em></u> replaces searching in the Use phase of the Big Data life cycle. One reason for continuous, automated monitoring of trends and outliers in Big Data is that unlike with traditional business data, decision makers will frequently not know what &ldquo;story&rdquo; Big Data tells or what questions to use data analytics to answer. Monitoring can help to discover the right questions to ask in order to find the message hidden within Big Data.</p>
      <p>The sheer volume, as well as variety, of Big Data also changes the selection of tools used for data analysis. This gives rise to the term <u><em>Big Data analytics</em></u>. These analytical tools often require much more time to process data. However, recent attempts to simplify and expedite Big Data analytics have caused a convergence in the types of tools available for both traditional and Big Data analytics.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>The Long and the Short</h2>
      <p>In considering the design and implementation of an information system, it is best to see the end from the beginning. Data needs to be findable, accessible, understandable, and usable. The ILC and BDLC provide blueprints that facilitate this perspective by explaining what a fully functional information system should do, and these life cycle steps guide the assessment of an organization's informational needs and the subsequent development of the system itself.</p>
