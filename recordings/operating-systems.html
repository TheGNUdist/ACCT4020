          <p>Software is a fundamental part of technology. Software performs all of the automated tasks and facilitates the manual tasks in the information system. Software stores and retrieves data; software analyzes and generates reports. Without software, none of the other technology components could serve their intended purpose. The <u><em>operating system</em></u> (OS) is a fundamental piece of software. It provides a platform for the functionality of the information system.</p>
        </div>

    <section>
      <h2>OSS OS</h2>
      <p>The capabilities of the operating system have a strong influence over the capabilities of the information system, and open source has had a strong influence over the capabilities of enterprise-grade operating systems. Despite the popularity of Microsoft Windows and Apple macOS on personal computers, the most widely used enterprise-grade operating systems are open source. Furthermore, the open source development of enterprise-grade operating systems has galvanized the open source movement, and the wide adoption of open source software in enterprise-grade information systems is due to the successes in developing open source operating systems.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Unintended Consequences</h2>
      <p>The original creator of the most successful enterprise-grade OS had not intended to develop the software for enterprise use. This is one of the hallmarks of crowdsourcing and open sourcing: the influence of the community at large over the final product. Eric Raymond illustrates this effect in his book <u>The Cathedral and the Bazaar</u>. The cathedral represents a development model in which the creator determines the direction of the product, and the bazaar represents a development model in which the community jointly determines the direction of the product. (Many understand this to be a comparison between closed and open source development, but it is actually a comparison of two open source products.) Because of the open mentality, the community grew this OS project to be much larger than the creator had envisioned.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>UNIX</h2>
      <p>The history of current enterprise-grade operating systems begins with UNIX. Although it is not an open source OS, its development model, as well as its history, have strongly influenced the functionality of its open source competitors.</p>
      <p>In 1969, researchers at AT&amp;T Bell Laboratories became dissatisfied with Multics, the operating system that they had begun to develop with MIT and General Electric, and they decided to develop an alternative operating system, which they named UNIX. UNIX engineers operated under a philosophy that continues to govern software development: <q>Write programs that do one thing and do it well.</q> One popular representation of this philosophy is KISS (Keep It Simple, Stupid!).</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Licensing</h2>
      <p>In 1973, AT&amp;T began selling UNIX licenses&mdash;AT&amp;T was a regulated company and could only sell licenses and not software&mdash;to universities and corporations. Unlike common current software licenses, UNIX licenses included source code and no other support. The availability of source code and the lack of commercial support motivated licensees to form communities that supported, modified, and improved on the operating system. Several of these development groups were founded by universities and funded by research grants, which was common for software development at that time. These efforts were similar to open source development, except that users could only share their improvements with other UNIX licensees because no one without a license was allowed to own a copy of UNIX.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Microsoft Who?</h2>
      <p>As an aside, in 1978, a small, unknown company named Microsoft purchased a UNIX license and began creating the UNIX-based operating system Xenix. UNIX was designed for large servers or mainframes, and Bill Gates designed Xenix for what he believed was the impending proliferation of personal computers. Microsoft eventually abandoned Xenix in favor of MS-DOS, which was the foundation for the most popular operating system for personal computers: Microsoft Windows. However, the brief existence of Xenix is evidence of a very important point: UNIX is not merely an alternative to Microsoft Windows. UNIX was the operating system of choice before anyone had heard of Microsoft. The subsequent creation of UNIX-like operating systems&mdash;operating systems that mimic the functionality of UNIX&mdash;reinforces its importance.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>System V</h2>
      <p>In 1983, AT&amp;T struck a blow against crowdsourcing. Bell Systems broke up after an antitrust case, and AT&amp;T became able to sell UNIX software, not only licenses. AT&amp;T released a commercialized UNIX System V and forbade access to UNIX source code. This restriction essentially ended community UNIX development.</p>
      <blockquote class="print-centered">Knowing no other model than secrecy for collecting profits from software and no other model than centralized control for developing a commercial product, AT&amp;T clamped down hard on source-code distribution.<br>&ndash; Eric Raymond</blockquote>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>BSD</h2>
      <p>Before AT&amp;T stopped distributing UNIX source code, the University of California, Berkeley had purchased a UNIX license and begun modifying the operating system. Berkeley subsequently released their modifications as a separate operating system, which they called BSD (Berkeley Software Distribution). Through the fourth release of BSD (4BSD), users needed to have purchased a UNIX license from AT&amp;T. Interestingly, many licensees, including employees of AT&amp;T's Bell Labs, preferred 4BSD to System V, and the Defense Advanced Research Project (DARPA) funded the creation of the Computer Systems Research Group (CSRG) at Berkeley to develop a BSD for ARPAnet, the precursor to the Internet.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>An Open Standard</h2>
      <p>Despite the appeal of both System V UNIX and BSD UNIX, disputes arose between the programming communities. In an attempt to reconcile differences, the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) developed a set of <u><em>Portable Operating System Interface</em></u> (POSIX) standards based on System V UNIX which continue to govern UNIX and UNIX-like operating systems today. The list of POSIX-certified operating systems currently contains the three most prominent UNIX offerings: IBM AIX, HP-UX and Oracle Solaris. Although BSD is not POSIX-certified, it is mostly POSIX compliant. Today, the POSIX standard continues to be a valuable standard for enterprise-grade open source operating systems.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>BSD Becomes Free</h2>
      <p>Starting in 1992, CSRG began replacing the remaining AT&amp;T code in 4BSD with code that they had written. Once CSRG had removed all AT&amp;T code, it released 386BSD as a free UNIX-compatible operating systems for Intel's 80386 processor, an early iteration of the x86 line of CPUs. This was the first prominent example of an operational, enterprise-grade, open source operating system. Similar to the early days of UNIX, communities immediately formed to continue development of 386BSD. This led to two forks of 386BSD: NetBSD for technical users and FreeBSD for less technical personal computer users. Because the CSRG released 386BSD freely to users without UNIX licenses, AT&amp;T sued Berkeley claiming that 386BSD contained proprietary code.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>After the Suit</h2>
      <p>Berkeley was finally exonerated, and the court only required minor changes to the BSD source code. The resulting code was released as 4.4BSD-lite. Unfortunately, the legal uncertainty during the two-year suit encouraged many BSD community members and developers to transition to a new, alternative open source, UNIX-like operating system called Linux. However, BSD remains widely used and supported, and many flavors (i.e., operatings systems based on BSD) exist. The most prominent are FreeBSD, NetBSD, OpenBSD (focused on security) and macOS. Furthermore, most operating systems, including Microsoft Windows, use network tools from BSD. In 2006, InformationWeek rated 4BSD as the &ldquo;Greatest Software Ever Written&rdquo; and the &ldquo;Theoretical Undergirder of the Internet.&rdquo;</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Linux</h2>
      <p>Linux is currently the most widely adopted operating system. It began in 1991 when Linus Torvalds, a Finnish university student, decided to develop a free UNIX-compatible kernel from scratch as a hobby. Today, 70% of Internet servers, 55% of mobile devices and 100% of supercomputers run Linux. It is also the operating system of choice for many single-board computers, such as the Raspberry Pi. Although Linux is one development project, the resulting operating system has over 600 different versions (called distributions or distros, for short). The developers of each of these distributions benefit from the open source nature of Linux by being able to modify the kernel and userland to provide a specialized user experience.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Operating System</h2>
      <p>Operating systems include a <u><em>kernel</em></u> and <u><em>userland</em></u>. They also rely on two additional supporting tools: a <u><em>firmware interface</em></u> and a <u><em>bootloader</em></u>. In order to keep the operating system out of the user's way, many operating systems package the kernel, userland, and bootloader together. Linux and BSD are modular. They each only have one kernel, but they offer multiple different userland environments and bootloaders. Modularity is a key characteristic of an open system. It allows the users to create different systems by choosing different combinations of tools.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>At the Heart of the Matter</h2>
      <p>The kernel is the part of the operating system that interacts with the computer hardware. This is the lowest level of the operating system. The kernel receives requests from user applications to access computer hardware, such as the CPU, RAM, storage, audio, or video, and forwards these requests to the hardware components. Once the request is fulfilled, the kernel returns the results of the request to the application. For example, if the user wishes to listen to an audio file, the application sends the audio to the kernel, and the kernel forwards the audio to the motherboard and the speakers.</p>
      <p>When the kernel is not familiar with a certain type of hardware, users can add device drivers as kernel modules to provide the kernel with additional functionality.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Services</h2>
      <p>User applications communicate with the kernel by means of <u><em>services</em></u>. Services receive and process requests, manage access to centralized resources, and deliver data. They can be part of the kernel (monolithic kernel), or they can be in userland and communicate with the kernel (microkernel). Both Linux and BSD have monolithic kernels. MacOS and iOS use a hybrid kernel, which includes some services in the kernel and some in userland.</p>
      <p>The term &ldquo;service&rdquo; is motivation for the word <u><em>server</em></u>. Although &ldquo;server&rdquo; is frequently used to identify a specific type of computer hardware, a more appropriate definition would be <u><em>software that provides a service</em></u>. Several services run as <u><em>daemons</em></u> which are applications that run in the background without user input.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Userland</h2>
      <p>Userland is the part of the operating system that the user interacts with. The user interacts with userland by means of the <u><em>shell</em></u>, which provides the user with either a text-based user interface, commonly referred to as a terminal or a console, or a graphical user interface (GUI). Almost all personal computers and mobile devices have graphical shells, but the vast majority of servers only have terminals. These shells receive commands from the user, and they provide user applications when requested.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>GNU/Linux</h2>
      <p>BSD is both kernel and userland in one. Linux, on the other hand, is merely the kernel. Many of the userland tools come from another project. Before Linus Torvalds began developing Linux, Richard Stallman attempted to provide a free UNIX-compatible operating system call GNU OS. The GNU project was not successful in developing a kernel, but it created many userland tools. The resulting Linux operating system is a combination of the Linux kernel and GNU userland. Because the userland tools come from the GNU project, Richard Stallman insists that the Linux operating system should actually be called GNU/Linux to highlight the contributions of both projects. The Debian GNU/Linux distribution has adopted this name, but most others prefer the shorter label of just Linux.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Package Managers</h2>
      <p>One of the trademarks of BSD and Linux is the <u><em>package manager</em></u>. The package manager manages the installation and updating of all software packages in the operating system. Each software <u><em>package</em></u> contains one or more applications. The benefit of a package manager is two-fold. First, the package manager provides the user with access to a vast collection of software repositories (i.e., data stores) that contain most applications the user would need. Linux and BSD users rarely need to search the Web for applications to download and install because the software repos often have a solution. Second, the package manager provides a single solution for keeping all applications and the operating system itself up to date. The command line is the primary interface for the package manager.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>App Store</h2>
      <p>To use more familiar language, the package manager is like a command-line version of an app store, and the software repositories store all of the available apps. Just as an app store plays the simultaneous roles of providing new apps for download and keeping installed apps up to date, the package manager with its software repositories provides most applications that a user would need (e.g., office software, multimedia applications, games, etc.) and serves to keep installed applications up to date. Knowing the commands to refresh the app list, upgrade existing software, installing new software, and uninstalling software that is no longer needed makes Linux and BSD as convenient as popular mobile operating systems, which are, by the way, based on Linux (Android) and BSD (iOS), respectively.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Command Line</h2>
      <p>Linux graphical shells, also called desktop environments or window managers, function similarly to the graphical shells of other desktop operating systems. Much of the power of Linux is in the text shell, and system administrators almost exclusively use the command line in a terminal to manage Linux computers. Knowledge of Linux terminal commands is a valuable competency. The most basic commands are the same across all Linux distributions, as well as BSD and UNIX. As a result, familiarity with a few line commands can immediately unlock basic functionality of most enterprise-grade operating systems. More advanced commands, such as how to control system daemons or the package manager, vary from distribution to distribution.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Commands and Applications</h2>
      <p>Both graphical and text shells provide users with convenient methods for launching applications. In graphical shells, this method often includes icons or launchers. In text shells, this method involves the use of <u><em>commands</em></u>, hence the term &ldquo;command line.&rdquo; The terms &ldquo;command&rdquo; and &ldquo;application&rdquo; may be used interchangeably, just as the terms &ldquo;icon&rdquo; and &ldquo;application&rdquo; may be used interchangeably, but they are not synonymous. Icons and commands are executable files that contain the instructions for launching applications. In a text shell, these commands often have the same name as the application to make finding the command and launching the application easier. Likewise, a software package may have the same name as the application, or one of the applications, it contains. However, this is not always the case.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Linux Distributions</h2>
      <p>Although over 600 different Linux distributions currently exist, many of these vary only by the software applications included by default with the operating system. However, a user can have distro A mimic distro B simply by using the package manager to install the applications from distro B on distro A.<p>
      <p>A much smaller number of distributions families exist. These families differ from one another by the choice of package manager. The package manager determines software compatibility, and an application written for one package manager will not be compatible with an operating system that uses a different package manager. The most common package managers are DEB-based; the second most common are RPM-based.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Dependencies</h2>
      <p>Software applications rarely include all code necessary to perform their intended functions. One reason for this is that multiple applications can share the same functionality and duplicating the code would be inefficient. As a result, many applications rely on software <u><em>libraries</em></u>. Just as a physical library provides a shared store of knowledge, a software library provides applications with a shared store of functionality.</p>
      <p>Libraries that an application needs in order to function properly represent <u><em>dependencies</em></u> of that application. Many package managers identify and install all dependencies when installing a software application. This makes software administration much easier for the user.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Firmware Interface &amp; Bootloader</h2>
      <p>The kernel and userland make an operating system, but in order for the operating system to be available to the user, a firmware interface is necessary. <u><em>Firmware</em></u> is software embedded hardware that controls that hardware. Two common computer firmware interfaces are <u><em>Basic Input/Output System</em></u> (BIOS) or, more recently <u><em>Unified Extensible Firmware Interface</em></u> (UEFI). This firmware resides on the motherboard's own flash storage, and it performs two important functions. The first is to initialize and test the computer hardware, and the second is to load the <u><em>bootloader</em></u>. The bootloader contains the instructions necessary to locate and boot the operating system kernel. Once the bootloader initializes the kernel, the operating system kernel launches any necessary services, daemons, and the user shell.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Powering the Software</h2>
      <p>The operating system is a complex collection of kernel and userland tools. Designers and maintainers of information systems must understand operating system administration and functionality, but not for the sake of the operating system itself. The purpose of the operating system is to power the information system applications, provide data storage, and serve and process data for the users.</p>
      <p>Most companies have chosen Linux as the operating system of choice for their information system. The Linux kernel is one of the most successful open source projects. More than 13,000 developers contribute more than 4,500 lines of code per day. It powers the Android operating system and the Web services of Netflix, Amazon, Google, and many others.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Microsoft <span style="color: red">&hearts;</span> Linux</h2>
      <p>On June 1, 2001, then-CEO of Microsoft Steve Ballmer said, &ldquo;Linux is a cancer that attaches itself in an intellectual property sense to everything it touches.&rdquo; This is probably a fitting sentiment for the leader of a company whose market position is threatened by open-source alternatives to its main products, specifically Windows and, to a lesser extent, Office. However, it turns out that great innovation is visible by its fruits, and Linux has persisted and grown in popularity despite this early accusation, so much so that Steve Ballmer's successor Satya Nadella said in 2015, &ldquo;Microsoft &hearts; Linux.&rdquo; Since then, Microsoft has even begun to ship Windows with the Linux kernel to power Windows Subsystem for Linux, which allows users to run Linux distributions from within Microsoft Windows.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>But the Winner Is...</h2>
      <p>As an aside, despite the continued popularity of Linux in enterprise-grade information systems, it turns out that it is not the most widely used operating system. Thanks to Intel's decision to embed it in all of their CPUs, MINIX is the most widely used operating system, even though the computer user never actually interacts with it. MINIX is another open source, UNIX-like operating system developed by Andrew S. Tanenbaum, originally intended as an educational tool. The permissive BSD license that applies to the MINIX source code allowed Intel to convert the open source operating system into a proprietary operating system that they could secretly embed in their CPUs as what they call &ldquo;Management Engine.&rdquo;</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>A Heads Up Would Have Been Nice</h2>
      <p>Tanenbaum, after hearing that his OS is now the most widely used in the world, simply said, &ldquo;This was a complete surprise. I don't mind, of course, and was not expecting any kind of payment since that is not required. There isn't even any suggestion in the license that it would be appreciated. The only thing that would have been nice is that after the project had been finished and the chip deployed, that someone from Intel would have told me, just as a courtesy, that MINIX was now probably the most widely used operating system in the world on x86 computers. That certainly wasn't required in any way, but I think it would have been polite to give me a heads up, that's all.&rdquo;</p>
