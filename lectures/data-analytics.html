			<h2>Accounting Architecture</h2>
			<div class="flex-row">

					<p>Data analytics is the search for answers in data. It begins with the retrieval of data from storage, and paired with reporting, which is the final step in the Use section of the information life cycle, it is the ability to create information from data. Data analytics relies heavily on software, programming languages, and artificial intelligence, but analytical skills are more than just software expertise. Successful data analysis requires a knowledge of the data, the information life cycle, and a healthy dose of judgment.</p>
				</div>
			</div>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h2>Accounting Skills</h2>
			<p>Accounting firms want accountants with data analytics skills because data analytics improves compliance and assurance. Historically, internal and external auditors have reviewed a sample of transactions to conclude whether financial statement numbers are fairly represented and to look for the potential for fraud. More powerful analytical tools paired with increased storage capacity for financial transactions has created the opportunity for analyzing the entire population of transactions and not only a sample. This leads to greater assurance and greater ability to find fraud. The tax function also benefits because it can have increased assurance of the accuracy of tax numbers.</p>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h2>Hot Topic</h2>
			<p>Even more than accounting firms, industry firms desire analytical skills. The Information Era provides companies with more data than they can handle. Firms, such as Google and Facebook, have made billions of dollars without any physical assets to speak of because they have acquired data about consumer markets that they could sell. Firms have paid for this data because they believe that it contains information that will increase their profitability. Likewise, firms have begun to collect similar data for themselves with the same goal in mind. The Information Era has taught us that the firm with the best information wins. However, more data only leads to better information in the hands of a skilled analyst.</p>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h2>Not Only Big Data</h2>
			<p>Much of this data is Big Data in the sense that it has high volume, velocity, and variety, and much of the desire for data analytics skills is related to the difficulty in finding answers in Big Data quickly. As a result, some prefer the moniker &ldquo;Big Data analytics,&rdquo; but data analytics is not only for Big Data, especially in an accounting context. Traditional financial data is not necessarily in the realm of Big Data, but data analytics improves the analysis of this data for compliance and decision making purposes. Furthermore, much of Big Data is unrelated to compliance, so data analytics from the perspective of an accountant will not necessarily imply Big Data.</p>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h2>But Still Big Data</h2>
			<p>However, the analysis of Big Data should matter to accountants. A fundamental accounting architecture is that accountants should act as stewards of all business information. Both traditional financial data and Big Data are useful for decision making, or rather business believe that Big Data holds secrets useful for decision making, and any data that has strategic implications is business data. Although compliance is an important aspect of accounting architecture, accountants are responsible for much more than compliance. As more firms look to Big Data for answers, accountants should increase the scope of their responsibilities to encompass this wealth of potential information. Any data that supports internal stakeholders is the purview of accountants.</p>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h2>Retrieval First</h2>
			<p>Effective data retrival is the bridge between data storage and data analytics. As a result, stored data is only useful if it is retrievable; irretrievable data may just as well not exist. Metadata is a primary requirement for data retrievability. By defining the data, metadata identifies the location and form of the desired data. Without metadata, data is indistinguishable making retrieval and subsequent analysis of specific data infeasible.</p>
			<p>Data retrival can take on many forms. Retrival from a relational database can involve combining multiple tables into a single flat file database. Retrieval from a document store can involve creating a new XML or JSON file from specific attributes and values across multiple documents.</p> 
		</section>

		<section>
			<h2>Analytical Tools</h2>
			<p>An analyst needs powerful data retrieval and analysis tools to find answers in traditional data and Big Data. Some of these tools are graphical applications, but several, perhaps even the majority, are text-based tools that require knowledge of command syntax. Syntax is the set of commands and formatting requirements of a specific programming language. Some languages focus specifically on data retrieval and analysis, whereas others are general-purpose languages that have proven valuable for data analytics. Despite the existence of proprietary tools, open source languages and tools dominate the field of data analytics. Even the Linux command line includes commands for data retrieval and analysis.</p>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h2>Before Tools</h2>
			<p>Because data analytics is a hot topic, it is easy to forget that the solution to finding answers in data is not simply to select the coolest analytical tool. Tools are valuable, even vital, but not sufficient. Knowledge of syntax is one part of data analytics, but just as with human language, syntax is useless without knowing what to comunicate. The ability to retrieveand analyze data begins with <u><em>understanding</em></u> and <u><em>judgment</em></u>: understanding of the data and the informational needs of stakeholders and sound judgment to consider the correct questions to ask and approach to take in order to find answers. Once an analyst has understanding and sound judgment, programming correct syntax is simply the translation of that understanding into a specific language.</p>

			<h2>SQL</h2>
			<p><u><em>Structured Query Language</em></u> (SQL) is the language for interacting with relational databases to create, modify, and retrieve data. Because of the prevalence of relational databases and because of the simplicity of its syntax, SQL has been and continues to a popular tool, and an increasing number of Big Data and data analytics systems have added support for this language.</p>
			<p>A query is a single request for data. An SQL query SELECTs a certain number of attributes FROM one table or multiple tables by JOINing the tables ON common attributes (e.g., primary and foreign keys). SQL can limit the records returned by the query to only those WHERE a specific condition is true. Results can be ORDERed BY an attribute's values in either ascending or descending order.</p>

			<h2>SQL Analysis</h2>
			<p>Basic SQL queries serve primarily to retrieve data for subsequent analysis. However, SQL can also perform some data analysis by calculating descriptive or summary statistics on table attributes. Summary statistics summarize a set of records. COUNT returns the number of records; SUM adds the values of a numerical attribute together; MIN, MAX, and AVG return the minimum, maximum, and average values of a numerical attribute, respectively. The query can calculate these statistics for an entire dataset or GROUPed BY an attribute's values. When grouping results, the query returns a summary statistic for each group. The query can also filter the results by selecting only those groups HAVING a specific condition (similar to a WHERE statement).</p>

			<h2>Indexing</h2>
			<p>In order to increase the speed of queries from a relational database, a relational database management system (RDBMS), which is software that manages a relational database, can create an index of the values in the tables. This index is similar to the index in the back of a textbook. When looking for records that match a particular value, such as a customer name, the RDBMS can find the value in the index, and the index will report which database records contain that value. This is quicker than looking through all records to find those with the desired value, just as it is quicker to use the index in a book to find pages that reference a certain topic than it is look through the entire book to find references to that topic.</p>

			<h2>OLAP</h2>
			<div class="flex-row">
				<div class="flex-item" style="max-width: 70%">
					<p><u><em>Online analytical processing</em></u> (OLAP) is another method for increasing query speed. OLAP creates either a pre-calculated hypercube (MOLAP) or a series of interconnected relational tables (ROLAP) from a existing database. Users can then quickly perform multidimensional queries, such as sales by quarter by location, with the added ability of <u><em>rolling up</em></u> for an aggregated view (e.g., sales <em>by year</em> by location), <u><em>drilling down</em></u> for a granular view (e.g., sales <em>by month</em> by location), and <u><em>slicing</em></u> and <u><em>dicing</em></u> to filter results along a dimension (e.g., sales <em>for Q1</em> by location).</p>

			<h2>Python and PERL</h2>
			<p><u><em>Python</em></u> and <u><em>PERL</em></u> are two general purpose languages. Both are heavily used for application and web development. However, because they rely heavily on <u><em>regular expressions</em></u> (Regex), they are useful for data retrieval. Regular expressions are sequences of characters that represent a set of other characters (e.g., any letter or any digit). Regex has two particularly valuable uses. First, it can text by its formatting without knowing what the exact text may be. Second, it can retrieve the values of a specified metadata attribute in a text file (e.g., the value of the VENDOR attribute in an XML file).</p>
			<p>Beyond its Regex functionality, Python can also interact with NoSQL databases and perform data analysis. As a result, expertise with Python is currently one of the most sought-after data analytics skills.</p>

			<h2>JavaScript</h2>
			<p><u><em>JavaScript</em></u> is a another general purpose programming language, which is used especially for Web development. Much of the functionality in Web pages, including the ability to load them in Web browsers, is the result of JavaScript. It has no connection to the similarly named programming language Java.</p>
			<p>In the field of data analytics, JavaScript has three particular strengths. First, because of its prevalence in Web development, it is already a familiar language to many data analysts. Second, it is compatible with many NoSQL databases. Third, it has an inherent connection to any document or document store <u><em>JavaScript Object Notation</em></u> (JSON), which is a metadata framework similar to XML.</p>

			<h2>R</h2>
			<p><u><em>R</em></u> is programming language specifically for data analysis. It is an open source alternative to SAS and Stata, which have been prominent analysis tools for more than a decade. Despite the popularity of these proprietary solutions, R is on its way to becoming the premier choice for two reasons. First, SAS and Stata are prohibitively expensive. Because of their high license fees, these tools are primarily reserved for large corporations and universities. R extends the availability of analytical tools to the general population. Second, because R is open source, an active community continually adds functionality to it, increasing the power of this tool. One popular use for R is <u><em>linear regression</em></u>, which is a statistical method for measuring the extent to which changes in certain inputs affect the level of an output.</p>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h2>Hadoop</h2>
			<p><u<em>Apache Hadoop</em></u> was the first prominent tool for analyzing Big Data. It is an open source project by the Apache Foundation, who is very active in both data analytics and Web development. Hadoop is large enough that it requires at least three connected computers (nodes) to run. Users give Hadoop commands written in Java and Hadoop uses the <u><em>MapReduce</em></u> model to shrink the data sufficiently to find an answer. MapReduce involves three steps. In the Map step, each processing node receives a portion of the data and maps each data item (i.e., key) to a value. In the Shuffle step, each node receives data grouped by key. In the Reduce step, the nodes calculate a summary statistic by key.</p>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h2>MapReduce Example</h2>
			<p>For example, a Hadoop installation with three nodes wants to look for the occurrence of the words love, money, and art on Twitter. These words are three keys. In the Map step, each node receives one third of all Tweets. Each node reads every word in all assigned Tweets and gives each occurrence of any of the three words a value of 1. At the end of the Map step, each node will have some number key-value pairs of love:1, money:1, and art:1, respectively. In the Shuffle step, each node receives all occurrences of one of the three words. In the Reduce step, each node counts the number of occurrences of each word and returns the total number of occurrences. The end result will be love:number of times love occurs, money:number of times money occurs, and art:number of times art occurs.</p>

			<p>Despite Hadoop's ability to manage large datasets, users dislike it for two reasons. First, it requires Java-based queries, which are much more complicated than SQL queries. Second, it cannot process queries in real time. Completing an entire MapReduce cycle can take days or weeks. Users must plan well in advance for answers they may want in the future. In the current competitive environment, decision makers want answers to Big Data questions in minutes, not weeks. <u><em>Apache Spark</em></u> attempts to overcome both of these weaknesses simultaneously by replacing the MapReduce engine with an ROLAP engine. ROLAP is OLAP that uses relational database tables for storage. This allows for real-time, SQL-based queries. The introduction of Spark has reinforced the value of SQL expertise.</p>

			<h2>Accounting-specific Tools</h2>
			<p>These analytical tools are all examples of general-use analytical tools; they are not specifically geared toward financial data. This is not a weakness of these solutions, but it has provided the opportunity for companies to offer accounting- and auditing-specific analytical tools. Two prominent examples are ACL Analytics (previously, ACL Audit Analytics) and CaseWare IDEA. These are proprietary, graphical tools that accountants can use to analyze and report on financial data. Both tools predate the current Big Data era because transaction sampling and statistical analysis have long since been a core component of financial audits. As firms make more data available to auditors, these tools have allowed for replacing sampling with analysis of population data. Some audit textbooks include examples and exercises from these software products.</p>

			<h2>Artificial Intelligence</h2>
			<p>Many of these analytical tools begin with data and a human who wants to find an answer to a pre-selected question. With Big Data, often the data holds the answer to a question, but the human has not yet discovered that question. In these cases, the data and the analytical tool can discover both the question and the answer. However, even in this scenario, human judgment has remained a necessary component. With increases in computing power and with the vastness of available data, <u><em>machine learning</em></u> and <u><em>artificial intelligence</em></u> have begun to replace human judgment with artificial judgment. AI can learn from existing data to understand what trends matter, what questions to ask, and what answers to find in new data sets. This may be the future of analytics, but for now, human judgment remains valuable.</p>

			<h2>Which Tool to Choose?</h2>
			<p>Data analytics is an important part of the current professional landscape for accountants, and employers want accountants with data analytics skills. The path to becoming an analyst begins with understanding and judgment, but the next step involves selecting a tool. Multiple choices exist with their various advantages and disadvantages. Although employers want Python, SQL, R, and JavaScript are also sought after. No tool is clearly the best, and sometimes the best choice is simply the tool with which the analyst is most comfortable. That may not be obvious in the beginning, and selecting a tool may necessitate a blind step forward on a particular path. Becoming a data analyst is a process with many paths to take. Pick and tool; pick a path.</p>
