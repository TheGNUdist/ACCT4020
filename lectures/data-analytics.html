			<h2>Accounting Architecture</h2>
			<div class="flex-row">

				<div class="flex-item" style="max-width: 65%">
					<p>Data analytics is the search for answers in data. It begins with the retrieval of data from storage, and paired with reporting, which is the final step in the Use section of the information life cycle, it is the ability to create information from data. Data analytics relies heavily on software, programming languages, and artificial intelligence, but analytical skills are more than just software expertise. Successful data analysis requires a knowledge of the data, the information life cycle, and a healthy dose of judgment.</p>
				</div>

			<h2>Accounting Skills</h2>
			<p>Accounting firms want accountants with data analytics skills because data analytics improves compliance and assurance. Historically, internal and external auditors have reviewed a sample of transactions to conclude whether financial statement numbers are fairly represented and to look for the potential for fraud. More powerful analytical tools paired with increased storage capacity for financial transactions has created the opportunity for analyzing the entire population of transactions and not only a sample. This leads to greater assurance and greater ability to find fraud. The tax function also benefits because it can have increased assurance of the accuracy of tax numbers.</p>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h2>Hot Topic</h2>
			<p>Even more than accounting firms, industry firms desire analytical skills. The Information Era provides companies with more data than they can handle. Firms, such as Google and Facebook, have made billions of dollars without any physical assets to speak of because they have acquired data about consumer markets that they could sell. Firms have paid for this data because they believe that it contains information that will increase their profitability. Likewise, firms have begun to collect similar data for themselves with the same goal in mind. The Information Era has taught us that the firm with the best information wins. However, more data only leads to better information in the hands of a skilled analyst.</p>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h2>Not Only Big Data</h2>
			<p>Much of this data is Big Data in the sense that it has high volume, velocity, and variety, and much of the desire for data analytics skills is related to the difficulty in finding answers in Big Data quickly. As a result, some prefer the moniker &ldquo;Big Data analytics,&rdquo; but data analytics is not only for Big Data, especially in an accounting context. Traditional financial data is not necessarily in the realm of Big Data, but data analytics improves the analysis of this data for compliance and decision making purposes. Furthermore, much of Big Data is unrelated to compliance, so data analytics from the perspective of an accountant will not necessarily imply Big Data.</p>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h2>But Still Big Data</h2>
			<p>However, the analysis of Big Data should matter to accountants. A fundamental accounting architecture is that accountants should act as stewards of all business information. Both traditional financial data and Big Data are useful for decision making, or rather business believe that Big Data holds secrets useful for decision making, and any data that has strategic implications is business data. Although compliance is an important aspect of accounting architecture, accountants are responsible for much more than compliance. As more firms look to Big Data for answers, accountants should increase the scope of their responsibilities to encompass this wealth of potential information. Any data that supports internal stakeholders is the purview of accountants.</p>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h2>Retrieval First</h2>
			<p>Effective data retrival is the bridge between data storage and data analytics. As a result, stored data is only useful if it is retrievable; irretrievable data may just as well not exist. Metadata is a primary requirement for data retrievability. By defining the data, metadata identifies the location and form of the desired data. Without metadata, data is indistinguishable making retrieval and subsequent analysis of specific data infeasible.</p>
			<p>Data retrival can take on many forms. Retrival from a relational database can involve combining multiple tables into a single flat file database. Retrieval from a document store can involve creating an XML or JSON document </p> 
		</section>

		<section>
			<h2>Analytical Tools</h2>
			<p>An analyst needs powerful data retrieval and analysis tools to find answers in traditional data and Big Data. Some of these tools are graphical applications, but several, perhaps even the majority, are text-based tools that require knowledge of command syntax. Syntax is the set of commands and formatting requirements of a specific programming language. Some languages focus specifically on data retrieval and analysis, whereas others are general-purpose languages that have proven valuable for data analytics. Despite the existence of proprietary tools, open source languages and tools dominate the field of data analytics. Even the Linux command line includes commands for data retrieval and analysis.</p>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h2>Before Tools</h2>
			<p>Because data analytics is a hot topic, it is easy to forget that the solution to finding answers in data is not simply to select the coolest analytical tool. Tools are valuable, even vital, but not sufficient. Knowledge of syntax is one part of data analytics, but just as with human language, syntax is useless without knowing what to comunicate. The ability to retrieveand analyze data begins with <u><em>understanding</em></u> and <u><em>judgment</em></u>: understanding of the data and the informational needs of stakeholders and sound judgment to consider the correct questions to ask and approach to take in order to find answers. Once an analyst has understanding and sound judgment, programming correct syntax is simply the translation of that understanding into a specific language.</p>

			<h2>SQL</h2>
			<p><u><em>Structured Query Language</em></u> is the language for interacting with relational databases to create, modify, and retrieve data. (Although the name NoSQL literally stands for &ldquo;Not Only SQL,&rdquo; NoSQL databases have little to no support for SQL, and instead rely on other languages for data manipulation.) Because of the prevalence of relational databases and ease of use, SQL remains a popular tool, and an increasing number of Big Data and data analytics systems have added support for this language.</p>

			<h2>Indexing</h2>
			<p>In order to increase the speed of queries from a relational database, the RDBMS can create an index of the values in the tables. This index is similar to the index in the back of a textbook. When looking for records that match a particular value, such as a customer name, the RDBMS can find the value in the index, and the index will report which database records contain that value. This is quicker than looking through all records to find those with the desired value, just as it is quicker to use the index in a book to find pages that reference a certain topic than it is look through the entire book to find references to that topic.</p>

			<h2>OLAP</h2>
			<div class="flex-row">
				<div class="flex-item" style="max-width: 74%">
					<p><u><em>Online analytical processing</em></u> (OLAP) is another method for increasing query speed. OLAP creates either a pre-calculated hypercube (MOLAP) or a series of interconnected relational tables (ROLAP) from a existing database. Users can then quickly perform multidimensional queries, such as sales by quarter by location, with the added ability of rolling up for an aggregated view (e.g., sales <em>by year</em> by location), drilling down for a granular view (e.g., sales <em>by month</em> by location), and slicing and dicing to filter results along a dimension (e.g., sales <em>for Q1</em> by location).</p>

				<div class="flex-item" style="max-width: 45%">
					<p><u><em>JavaScript</em></u> is a general purpose programming language&mdash;it is especially useful for web development&mdash; but it is also valuable for data analytics because of its ability to interact with NoSQL databases, especially document stores using JavaScript Object Notation (JSON), which is a metadata framework similar to XML.</p>

			<h2>Python and PERL</h2>
			<p><u><em>Python</em></u> and <u><em>PERL</em></u> are two other general purpose languages. However, because they rely heavily on <u><em>regular expressions</em></u> (Regex), which are sequences of characters that allow for convenient retrieval of strings in text files, they are useful for data, and specifically textual analysis. One use might be to look for specific words in the body of all Twitter posts.</p>
			<div>Regex Examples</div>
			<div class="table" style="font-size: 20px; border: 3px solid black">
				<div class="table-row" style="background-color: white">
					<div class="table-cell">(\d{1,2}\/\d{1,2}\/\d{4})</div>

			<h2>R</h2>
			<div class="flex-row">
				<div class="flex-item" style="max-width: 80%">
					<p><u><em>R</em></u> is programming language specifically for data analysis. It is an open source alternative to SAS and Stata, which have been prominent analysis tools for more than a decade. Despite the popularity of these proprietary solutions, R is on its way to becoming the <i>de facto</i> choice for two reasons. First, SAS and Stata are prohibitively expensive, and second, because R is open source, the community has add functionality to it, increasing the power of this analysis tool. One popular use for R is linear regression, which is a statistical tool for measuring the extent to which certain inputs affect the level of an output.</p>

			<h2>Hadoop</h2>
			<p><u<em>Apache Hadoop</em></u> was the first prominent tool for analyzing Big Data. It is large enough that it requires at least three connected computers (nodes) to run. Users give Hadoop commands written in Java&mdash;which is different from JavaScript&mdash;and Hadoop uses the <u><em>MapReduce</em></u> model to shrink the data sufficiently to find an answer. Unsurprisingly, MapReduce involves three steps. In the Map step, each processing node receives a portion of the data and maps each data item (i.e., key) to a value. In the Shuffle step, each node receives data grouped by key. In the Reduce step, the nodes calculate a summary statistic by key.</p>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h2>MapReduce Example</h2>
			<p>For example, a Hadoop installation with three nodes wants to look for the occurrence of the words love, money, and art on Twitter. In the Map step, each node receives one third of all Twitter posts and gives occurrence of any of the three words (i.e., keys) a value of 1. In the Shuffle step, each node receives all occurrences of one of the three words. In the Reduce step, each node counts the number of occurrences of each word and returns the total number of occurrences.</p>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h2>Spark</h2>
			<p>Despite Hadoop's ability to manage large datasets, users dislike it for two reasons. First, it requires Java-based queries, which are much more complicated than SQL queries, and second, it cannot process queries in real time, so users must plan in advance for answers they may want in the future. <u><em>Apache Spark</em></u> attempts to overcome both of these weaknesses simultaneously by replacing the MapReduce engine with an ROLAP engine. This allows for real-time, SQL-based queries.</p>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h2>Accounting-specific Tools</h2>
			<p>These analytical tools are all examples of general-use tools, in the sense that they are not specifically geared toward financial data. However, because of the value of data analytics in accounting, especially audit, developers have created accounting-specific tools. Two prominent examples are ACL Analytics (previously, ACL Audit Analytics) and CaseWare IDEA. These are proprietary, graphical tools that accountants can use to analyze and report on financial data. Some audit textbooks include examples and exercises from these software products.</p>

			<h2>Not Excel</h2>
			<p>Excel is a familiar business tool, and it is easy to stick with familiar tools to perform a variety of tasks. A wise person once said, &ldquo;If all you have is a hammer, every problem looks like a nail.&rdquo; Excel is a useful tool, but data analytics, especially Big Data analytics is not a nail. A needle in a haystack might be a more appropriate analogy. The willingness to apply the correct tool to the problem at hand will increase an analyst's ability to analyze data effectively and efficiently.</p>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h2>Artificial Intelligence</h2>
			<p>Many of these analytical tools begin with data and a human who wants to find an answer to a pre-selected question. With Big Data, often the data holds the answer to a question, but the human has not yet discovered that question, and the data and the analytical tools discover both the question and the answer. However, in both cases, human judgment remains a necessary component. With increases in computing power and with the vastness of available data, <u><em>machine learning</em></u> and <u><em>artificial intelligence</em></u> have begun to replace human judgment with computer learning. This will certainly have an impact on the future of the accounting profession.</p>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h2>Accounting Tie-in</h2>
			<p>Even if it is difficult to believe that accounting architecture is the future of the accounting profession, data analytics is an important part of the current professional landscape. In fact, the desire for data analytics is one reason for the value of accounting architecture. Employers want accountants with data analytics skills, and those who understand the information system and the information life cycle the best are best able to find answers in the data. Additionally, the best information systems will be most capable of acquiring and storing the data for analysis, and accounting architects can help design such a system.</p>
