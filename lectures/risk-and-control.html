      <h2>Accounting Architecture</h2>

          <p>Information is the keystone of any information system, and Technology is the set of tools necessary to implement that system. Control, however, is a choice. A system can function without proper controls, but a system without proper controls exposes internal and external stakeholders to risk. All entities are exposed to risk. Although entities cannot choose the risks, they can choose how to manage them.</p>

      <h2>Risky Business</h2>
      <p>Risks can take on many forms. Some risks target the business indirectly, such as economic risk and financial risk. Examples of economic risk are:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Industry competition</li>
        <li>Technological innovation</li>
        <li>Changes in tax, legal, or regulatory standards</li>
        <li>Economic trends</li>
        <li>Interest rates and availability of financing</li>
        <li>Energy and fuel costs</li>
        <li>Customer preferences</li>
        <li>Demand cyclicality</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Adapt or Perish</h2>
      <p>Several companies have failed because of an inability to thrive amid economic risk. One prominent example is the long list of construction companies that failed during the Great Recession of 2008 when consumers could no longer receive mortgage loans and home prices plummeted. Other examples include:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Blockbuster: Failed to transition to streaming</li>
        <li>Kodak: Failed to understand importance of digital photography and photo sharing</li>
        <li>Nokia &amp; Motorola: Failed to apply popularity of feature phones to smartphone arena</li>
        <li>HP &amp; Palm: Failed to compete in mobile computing market</li>
        <li>Borders: Failed to recognize the rise of ebooks</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Better Knowledge</h2>
      <p>In several cases, businesses failed under the pressure of economic risk because of an unwillingness or inability to change their business model following technological innovation. The accounting profession finds itself in a similar predicament. One solution to this problem is a willingness to accept change and not dig in when innovation occurs. The second solution is better information. Well-designed information systems can help companies manage economic risks by improving forecasts, maximizing business process efficiency, and supporting adaptation of strategic goals. Therefore, accountants have a choice: be a part of the problem by ignoring the risk or be a part of the solution by providing others with the information necessary to manage the risk.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Coming For You</h2>
      <p>Other risks target the business entity directly. Some of these are external threats, and some are internal threats. Today, the most prominent threats are <em><u>cyber incidents</u></em>, frequently referred to as cyber attacks. One form of cyber attack is <em><u>hacking</u></em>, which is an attempt to gain unauthorized access to a system. Another is <em><u>hijacking</u></em>, which is an attempt to make a system serve an unintended, usually nefarious, purpose. These incidents are perpetrated by both external and internal users. Regardless of the source, these risks can make a system unavailable to authorized users and can result in data loss, corruption, or leakage, as well as asset misappropriation. Additionally, certain internal risks can result in material misstatement of accounting numbers.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Sony</h2>
      <p>Sony is no stranger to cyber incidents. In April 2011, the PlayStation Network experienced a month-long outage following an attack that leaked 77 million accounts and over 12,000 credit card numbers. At the time it was viewed as the largest breach in history, and Sony estimated outage costs at $171 million. This number excludes the cost of litigation, fines, and consumer credit protection that Sony provided to all account holders.</p>
      <p>Then, in November 2014, a hacker group leaked data from Sony Pictures including employee information, private emails, and corporate documents and unreleased films. Sony has paid millions in connection with this attack.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Yahoo!</h2>
      <p>Yahoo is the grand champion of cyber incidents. In 2013 and 2014 combined, two data breaches affected over 1.5 billion accounts. Each breach by itself is larger than any breach experience by any other company in the history of the Internet. In both cases, hackers leaked account information and security data, including security questions and answers. Yahoo announced the breaches in 2016 after Verizon had made an offer to acquire Yahoo for $4.8 billion. Verizon subsequently reduced the price by $350 million. Additionally, Yahoo CEO Marissa Mayer forfeited bonuses for 2016 and 2017. Additional litigation is currently pending.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Ashley Madison</h2>
      <p>In August 2015, a group of hackers called &ldquo;The Impact Team&rdquo; leaked data from Avid Life Media Inc.'s website Ashley Madison that it had stolen one month prior in an attempt to blackmail the company into shutting down its service. The leaked data included corporate emails and the personal information of current and former users. Some of the former users had already paid to have their accounts deleted, but ALM failed to delete their data, even though the company claimed to have done so. As a result of this leak, ALM face a $568 million class-action lawsuit.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Credit Card Hack</h2>
      <p>Several retailers have experienced breaches of credit card data in recent years. Two of the most prominent members of this list are Target with 70 million customers affected and Home Depot with 56 million customers affected. In both cases, hackers remotely accessed and infected point-of-sale (POS) systems by using stolen login credentials from vendors. POS systems are a popular target for credit card theft, and several other retailers have also been affected, such as Wendy's, Staples, UPS, P.F. Chang's, Sally Beauty. However, in the case of the largest credit card leak, 94 million T. J. Maxx customers, hackers stole the credit card numbers from the corporate system simply by hacking the wireless network at a single store.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Locked Files</h2>
      <p>Cyber incidents can result in asset misappropriation without actually stealing anything. Thanks to an error in the Server Message Protocol (SMB) used by Microsoft Windows to share files, in May 2017, attackers were able to lock the files of over 200,000 computers worldwide in a single day. Infected computers included as many as 70,000 National Health Service hospital devices in Great Britain, and as a result, emergency rooms were forced to turn patients away. Many infected computers ran outdated versions of Windows, but the majority of affected devices ran current versions of Windows, and Microsoft had simply not chosen to fix this error despite being aware of it. Attacks using this vulnerability continued for several months.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Dyn</h2>
      <p>Dyn provides Domain Name System (DNS) services for the northeastern United States. On October 21, 2016, unprecedented number of hijacked IoT devices attacked Dyn rendering it unavailable for several hours. As a result, several websites were inaccessible by their URLs, including Twitter, Netflix, and Amazon. This outage cost these companies tens of thousands of dollars every minute, and immediately following the outage, Dyn lost 8% of its customer base as companies switched their traffic to other DNS providers. Although Dyn was the victim of this attack, the blame more appropriately lies with the manufacturers and owners of the infected IoT devices. However the loss from cyber attacks is indiscriminate. Even those not at fault lose.</p>

      <h2>Fraud Triangle</h2>
      <div class="flex-row">

        </div>
        <div class="flex-item" style="max-width: 60%">
          <p>The fraud triangle highlights the three forces that lead to fraudulent behavior, including cyber attacks. Both outsiders and insiders are subject to pressure and rationalization, but although cyber incidents by outsiders are the most common cause of data breaches, firm insiders are also able to cause significant damage through fraud because they can have greater opportunity to leak internal data.
        </div>
      </div>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Snowden &amp; Manning</h2>
      <p>Because of their ability to access data through legitimate channels, malicious insiders can pose a considerable risk. With respect to US government and military documents, ex-CIA employee Edward Snowden and US Army Specialist Bradley Manning both released classified data to the public. In 2010, Manning assisted Julian Assange, founder of WikiLeaks, in publishing documents and videos on the Iraq and Afghanistan wars, as well as Guantanamo Bay, and in 2013, Snowden leaked thousands of documents on NSA surveillance programs to reporters from various news outlets.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Facebook</h2>
      <p>Erroneous data leaks by insiders can be just as bad as intentional ones. In 2016, Facebook discovered that an error in their popular social media software revealed the personal profiles of content moderators to Facebook groups whose administrators the moderators had banned. This error exposed the personal profiles of more than 1,000 Facebook employees. Approximately 40 of these employees worked for Facebook's counter-terrorism unit in Facebook's European headquarters, and their profiles were leaked to the very terrorist groups they worked to ban. At least one of these employees went into hiding when he discovered that members of a terrorist group that he had worked against had viewed his profile.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>What's Best for Business</h2>
      <p>Data breaches are bad for business. According to <a href="http://www.gemalto.com/brochures-site/download-site/Documents/ent-Breach_Level_Index_Annual_Report_2015.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener" aria-label="PDF opens in new window">one report</a>, in 2015 over 700 million records were breached in nearly 1,700 cyber incidents. That equates to 22 records leaked every second. 62% of cyber incidents were initiated by outsiders, 14% were initiated by malicious insiders (i.e., fraud), and 24% were accidental (i.e., error). <a href="https://www.experian.com/assets/data-breach/white-papers/2015-industry-forecast-experian.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener" aria-label="PDF opens in new window">Experian</a> predicts that insider fraud and error will continue to be a significant contributor to data leaks. In 2014, US companies reported $40 billion in losses stemming from breaches caused by employees. Currently, companies lose billions of dollars more because of externally initiated cyber incidents, and by 2020, data breach costs may reach as high as $2 trillion worldwide.</p>

    <section>
      <h2>Internal Controls</h2>
      <p>In the same sense that better information can help companies manage market risks, <em><u>internal controls</u></em> can help companies manage fraud and error risks. Internal controls are activities or tools designed to protect data, assets, business processes, and compliance objectives (e.g., financial reporting) from error and fraud. In the context of the fraud triangle, internal controls primarily focus on reducing the opportunity to commit fraud (as well as cause unintentional errors), but certain control objectives also address perceived pressure and rationalization.</p>

      <h2>COSO</h2>
      <div class="flex-row">
        <div class="flex-item" style="max-width: 70%">
          <p>The <em><u>Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission</u></em> (COSO) has created a framework for designing and implementing internal controls that &ldquo;achieve the entity's objectives and adapt to changes in the business and operating environments.&rdquo; COSO identifies three control objectives, five components of internal control, and four entity units. The objectives highlight the business goals that require internal controls, and the units are the relevant business levels for implementing internal controls.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flex-item" style="max-width: 70%">
          <p>After creating Internal Control&ndash;Integrated Framework, COSO also designed a broader framework to address general risk management. Enterprise Risk Management&ndash;Integrated Framework applies to the same four business units, but it adds one objective: Strategic. The four objectives map directly into the Environment section of accounting architecture. Strategic, Operations, and (Internal) Reporting are Business Model, and (External) Reporting and Compliance are Compliance.</p>

    <section>
      <h2>Framework Component Purposes</h2>
      <p>The five components of Internal Control&ndash;Integrated Framework each contain a number of fundamental principles that guide internal decisions in designing and implementing effective internal controls to achieve the entity's objectives (i.e., Operations, Reporting, and Compliance). The framework's principles also attempt to eliminate inefficient controls. However, the difficulty is that <em>all</em> internal controls are inefficient, or rather all processes become less efficient by introducing internal controls. For example, requiring employees to sign in guests when entering the building is inefficient because it takes extra time. As a result, the focus of any internal control framework must be to aid management in identifying the least inefficient combination of internal controls by focusing on those that have the most benefit per unit of cost.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Cost-Benefit Analysis</h2>
      <p>The benefit of a control implementation is the reduction in the expected loss from a problem. Expected loss is the product of the <u><em>likelihood</em></u> of and the <u><em>exposure</em></u> to a problem. Likelihood is the probability of a problem, and exposure is the dollar loss from litigation, fines, lost business, cost of restoring a system and its data, etc., should a problem occur. <u><em>Preventive</em></u> controls can lower the likelihood of a problem, and <u><em>detective</em></u> and <u><em>corrective</em></u> controls can reduce the exposure (i.e., make a problem less bad or fix a problem more quickly). Any implementation of controls is costly, and although 100% prevention would be the best, the cost is prohibitive. As a result, the only option is a combination of all three types: preventing what can be prevented and detecting and correcting what cannot be prevented.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Benefit to Internal Stakeholders</h2>
      <p>Decision makers within the firm are the primary beneficiary of internal controls. Controls reduce the likelihood of misinformation, which would lead to incorrect strategic decisions, and they protect the confidentiality of trade secrets. Because internal stakeholders are the biggest &ldquo;customer&rdquo; of the information system, protecting them from risks becomes a primary goal of information system controls. Additionally, because firms can face serious consequences from external stakeholders in the event of a breach or outage, internal stakeholders also benefit from controls that protect the firm from litigation.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Benefit to External Stakeholders</h2>
      <p>The <u><em>Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002</em></u> (SOX) requires firms to implement internal controls over financial reporting to prevent material misstatements. Congress instituted this statute in response to the egregious accounting frauds in the lates 90s and early 2000s at Enron, Worldcom, and others. SOX sections 302 and 404 require management to maintain and assess internal controls over financial reporting. SOX complements GAAP and GAAS in protecting external stakeholders from financial misinformation. Other regulations and private contracts also require internal controls to prevent breaches of privacy, data loss, and system unavailability. As a result, Compliance requires the use of internal controls and reporting of cyber incidents, regardless of the intrinsic benefit to internal stakeholders.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Control Environment</h2>
      <p>The first internal control component is the <u><em>control environment</em></u>. This component focuses on the importance of having a strong &ldquo;tone at the top.&rdquo; The five principles of control environment are:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Organization commits to ethics and integrity.</li>
        <li>Board is independent of management and oversees the development of internal controls.</li>
        <li>Management establishes an organizational hierarchy with limits on individual authority.</li>
        <li>Organization commits to hire, develop, and retain competent employees.</li>
        <li>Employees are held accountable for their internal control responsibilities.</li>
      </ol>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>&ldquo;Tone at the Top&rdquo;</h2>
      <p>The importance of having a strong control environment is three-fold. First, without a commitment from management and the board, internal controls will never be implemented in the first place. Second, even if internal controls are in place, if management shows no interest in holding people accountable to them, they will be ineffectual. Third, because of their level of authority, executives can readily circumvent internal controls if they have not committed to follow them, which can lead to severe problems if these executives commit fraud or even simply make an undiscovered mistake.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Risk Assessment</h2>
      <p>The second internal control component is <u><em>risk assessment</em></u>. This component concentrates on the identification of risks that could prevent successful achievement of the entity's objectives. Its four principles are:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Organization specifies business objectives.</li>
        <li>Organization identifies potential internal and external risks and determines how to manage them.</li>
        <li>Organization considers the potential for fraud.</li>
        <li>Organization identifies environmental changes that could affect internal controls.</li>
      </ol>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Feedback</h2>
      <div class="flex-row">
        <div class="flex-item override"><img src="../images/arch.png" alt="Accounting Architecture Model" style="max-width: 300px"/></div>
        <div class="flex-item" style="max-width: 65%">
          <p>The need to evaluate the environment to predict changes in internal controls demonstrates the importance of feedback between the Environment blocks of accounting architecture. Risk affects the Business Model and Compliance, just as the Business Model affects Risk and Compliance, etc. Identifying changes in any of the three should trigger a reevaluation of the other two, as well as their informational needs.</p>
        </div>
      </div>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Information &amp; Communication</h2>
      <p>The third internal control component is <u><em>information and communication</em></u>. This component highlights the need to report on internal control activities. This creates a new level of informational need in the organization, in addition to the need to report on the business processes themselves. The three principles of this component are:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Management identifies information requirements of the internal control system.</li>
        <li>Employees internally communicate information to support proper functioning of internal controls.</li>
        <li>Organization reports on internal controls to external stakeholders.</li>
      </ol>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Monitoring Activities</h2>
      <p>The fourth internal control component is <u><em>monitoring activities</em></u>. Once internal controls are in place, or are believed to be in place, they must be monitored to confirm that they are present and functioning. The two principles of this component are:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Organization performs ongoing evaluations to ascertain whether internal controls are present and functioning.</li>
        <li>Employees communicate any observed internal control deficiencies to responsible parties in a timely fashion.</li>
      </ol>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Control Activities</h2>
      <p>The final internal control component is <u><em>control activities</em></u>. Although this is the last in the list, it should not be viewed as the final step in a sequence, nor should the other components be viewed as depicting a sequence of activities, rather these combine to create a blueprint of internal controls, just as the information life cycle creates a blueprint for an information system. This component focuses on the specific internal control activities. Its three principles are:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Organization selects control activities.</li>
        <li>Organization selects IT controls.</li>
        <li>Organization implements controls through explicit policies and procedures.</li>
      </ol>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Segregation of Duties</h2>
      <p>A primary control activity is <u><em>segregation of duties</em></u>, which discourages the assignment of multiple incompatible tasks to the same individual. General guidelines for identifying incompatible duties include:</p>
      <dl>
        <dt>Authorization</dt>
        <dd>Approving transactions, credit, and payment</dd>
        <dt>Recording</dt>
        <dd>Data entry and processing, generating reports, and maintaining databases</dd>
        <dt>Custody</dt>
        <dd>Handling cash, inventory, and fixed assets, as well as signing and receiving checks</dd>
      </dl>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Supervision</h2>
      <p>Segregation of duties is an excellent tool for discouraging fraud by requiring individuals to collude in order to succeed in performing and concealing the act. However, sometimes this tool is not available either because the number of available employees is too small and employees need to assume incompatible duties or because a single duty is risky (e.g., unloading inventory from a truck before it is counted or opening envelopes of cash in the mail room). In these situations, <u><em>supervision</em></u> is a second-best alternative. Supervision mimics the benefit of segregation of duties by requiring two individuals to be involved in performing a single task. In order to commit fraud, the responsible agent and the supervisor must collude. Supervision can also prevent error by including an additional set of eyes on a task.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Additional Control Activities</h2>
      <p>Other useful control activities include:</p>
      <dl>
        <dt>Serial numbering</dt>
        <dd>Serially numbering both physical and digital documents ensures that any missing records will be noticed and no additional records can be inserted. In a database environment, this can be handled by serially numbered primary key.</dd>
        <dt>Independent reconciliation</dt>
        <dd>Situations arise in which the same data occurs on multiple physical or digital documents. Reconciliation by an agent independent of those who created the data confirms that the data is the same across all copies and addresses any discrepancies.</dd>
      </dl>

      <h2>Business Cycle Controls</h2>
      <p>Flowcharts of business processes and cycles can demonstrate the existence of, as well as the need for, internal controls. The agent swimlanes highlight segregation of duties. The set of tasks assigned to a single agent can identify when supervision is necessary. Any document creation task can emphasize the need for serial numbering, and tasks with multiple data inputs can showcase the need for independent reconciliation. As a result, in addition to flowcharts' usefulness in identifying informational and reporting needs of business processes, flowcharts also serve as a tool for auditors and security specialists to determine where internal controls are and where they should be.</p>

      <h2>IT Controls</h2>
      <p>A subset of internal controls specifically address IT systems, and with the current trend toward increased automation in business processes, as well as the increased risk of cyber incidents, these IT controls have become more important. Unfortunately, the increased risk has also increased the cost of proper IT controls, and as a result, the temptation may exist to cut corners or forego IT controls in order to increase process efficiency or cut overhead costs.</p>
      <p>Despite this temptation, IT controls are vital for any information system. The goal of these controls is <u><em>reliability</em></u>. A reliable system consistently performs according to its specifications. That includes preventing unauthorized access and data corruption, protecting data confidentiality, and ensuring that users can access the system.</p>

      <h2>Think Like an Auditor</h2>
      <p>One of the roles of a financial auditor or an IT auditor is to assess internal controls. As a result, when designing and implementing internal controls, including IT controls, a good rule of thumb is to think as an auditor would think. Consider what controls an auditor would need to find in order to determine that the business operations and reporting activities were sufficiently controlled. This is one reason why companies prefer to hire former public accountants. They understand better how to satisfy the requirements of a financial and an IT audit. Familiarity with audit principles and standards can be a valuable tool for any accounting architect.</p>

      <h2>IT Control Framework</h2>
      <p>Similar to COSO's Internal Control&ndash;Integrated Framework, the AICPA has created the <u><em>Trust Services Criteria</em></u> (TSC) for designing and implementing IT controls. TSC fits into the broader scope of IC&ndash;IF and ERM&ndash;IF by addressing IT-specific risks and control activities. This framework contains five control concepts:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><u><em>Security</em></u> protects against unauthorized access.</li>
        <li><u><em>Confidentiality</em></u> and <u><em>privacy</em></u> maintain data secrecy.</li>
        <li><u><em>Availability</em></u> prevents data loss and system downtime.</li>
        <li><u><em>Processing integrity</em></u> preserves data integrity.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>These elements promote a reliable information system, and they are the components of the Control section of accounting architecture.</p>
