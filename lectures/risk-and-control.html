					<p>Information is the keystone of any information system, and Technology is the set of tools necessary to implement that system. Control, however, is a choice. A system can function without proper controls, but a system without proper controls exposes internal and external stakeholders to risk. Entities cannot choose the risks, but they can choose how to manage them.</p>

			<h3>Risky Business</h3>
			<p>Risks can take on many forms. Some risks target the business indirectly, such as economic risk and financial risk. Examples of economic risk are:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Industry competition</li>
				<li>Technological innovation</li>
				<li>Changes in tax, legal, or regulatory standards</li>
				<li>Economic trends</li>
				<li>Interest rates and availability of financing</li>
				<li>Energy and fuel costs</li>
				<li>Customer preferences</li>
				<li>Demand cyclicality</li>
			</ul>
		</section>
			
		<section>
			<h3>Adapt or Perish</h3>
			<p>Several companies have failed because of an inability to thrive amid economic risk. One prominent example is the long list of construction companies that failed during the Great Recession of 2008 when consumers could no longer receive mortgage loans and home prices plummeted. Other examples include:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Blockbuster: Failed to transition to streaming</li>
				<li>Kodak: Failed to understand importance of digital photography and photo sharing</li>
				<li>Nokia &amp; Motorola: Failed to apply popularity of feature phones to smartphone arena</li>
				<li>HP &amp; Palm: Failed to compete in mobile computing market</li>
				<li>Borders: Failed to recognize the rise of ebooks</li>
			</ul>

			<h3>Better Knowledge</h3>
			<p>In several cases, businesses failed under the pressure of economic risk because of an unwillingness or inability to change their business model following technological innovation. The accounting profession finds itself in a similar predicament. One solution to this problem is a willingness to accept change and not dig in when innovation occurs. The second solution is better information. Well-designed information systems can help companies manage economic risks by improving forecasts, maximizing business process efficiency, and supporting adaptation of strategic goals. Therefore, accountants have a choice: be a part of the problem by ignoring the risk or be a part of the solution be and provide others with the information necessary to manage the risk.</p>

			<h3>Coming For You</h3>
			<p>Other risks target the business entity directly. Some of these are external threats, and some are internal threats. Today, the most prominent external threats are <em><u>cyber incidents</u></em>, frequently referred to as cyber attacks or hacking. These are considered external risks because they are generally initiated by outsiders. Internal threats, perpetrated by current or former employees, can be either intentional (i.e., fraud) or unintentional (i.e., error). Regardless of the source, these risks can result in data loss, corruption, or leakage and asset misappropriation. Additionally, certain internal risks can result in material misstatement of accounting numbers.</p>

			<h3>Black Hat Tools</h3>
			<p>Hackers have a plethora of tools in their arsenal to engage in cyber attacks. Some tools rely on malware, which stands for malicious software, while others Some of the more common examples are:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Ransomware: Malware that encrypts the user's computer forcing the user to pay for a decryption key</li>
			</ul>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h3>Sony</h3>
			<p>Sony is no stranger to cyber incidents. In April 2011, the PlayStation Network experienced a month-long outage following an attack that leaked 77 million accounts and over 12,000 credit card numbers. At the time it was viewed as the largest breach in history, and Sony estimated outage costs at $171 million. This number excludes the cost of litigation, fines, and consumer credit protection that Sony provided to all account holders.</p>
			<p>Then, in November 2014, a hacker group leaked data from Sony Pictures including employee information, private emails, and corporate documents and unreleased films. Sony has paid millions in connection with this attack.</p>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h3>Yahoo!</h3>
			<p>Yahoo is the grand champion of cyber incidents. In 2013 and 2014 combined, two data breaches affected over 1.5 billion accounts. Each breach by itself is larger than any breach experience by any other company in the history of the Internet. In both cases, hackers leaked account information and security data, including security questions and answers. Yahoo announced the breaches in 2016 after Verizon had made an offer to acquire Yahoo for $4.8 billion. Verizon subsequently reduced the price by $350 million. Additionally, Yahoo CEO Marissa Mayer forfeited bonuses for 2016 and 2017. Additional litigation is currently pending.</p>

			<h3>Ashley Madison</h3>
			<p>In August 2015, a group of hackers called &ldquo;The Impact Team&rdquo; leaked data from Avid Life Media Inc.'s website Ashley Madison that it had stolen one month prior in an attempt to blackmail the company into shutting down its service. The leaked data included corporate emails and the personal information of current and former users. Some of the former users had already paid to have their accounts deleted, but ALM failed to delete their data, even though the company claimed to have done so. As a result of this leak, ALM face a $568 million class-action lawsuit.</p>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h3>Credit Card Hack</h3>
			<p>Several retailers have experienced breaches of credit card data in recent years. Two of the most prominent members of this list are Target with 70 million customers affected and Home Depot with 56 million customers affected. In both cases, hackers remotely accessed and infected point-of-sale (POS) systems by using stolen login credentials from vendors. POS systems are a popular target for credit card theft, and several other retailers have also been affected, such as Wendy's, Staples, UPS, P.F. Chang's, Sally Beauty. However, in the case of the largest credit card leak, 94 million T. J. Maxx customers, hackers stole the credit card numbers from the corporate system simply by hacking the wireless network at a single store.</p>

			<h3>Dyn</h3>
			<p>Dyn provides Domain Name System (DNS) services from the northeastern United States. On October 21, 2016, unprecedented number of IoT devices infected by Mirai rendered Dyn unavailable for several hours. As a result, several websites were inaccessible by their URLs, including Twitter, Netflix, and Amazon. This outage cost these companies tens of thousands of dollars every minute, and immediately following the outage, Dyn lost 8% of its customer base as companies switched their traffic to other DNS providers.</p>

			<h3>Fraud Triangle</h3>
			<p>Although cyber incidents by outsiders are the most common cause of data breaches, firm insiders are also able to cause significant damage through fraud and error.

			<h3>Information and Control</h3>
			<p>Well-designed information systems can help companies manage all types of risks.  by improving forecasts and sensitivity analysis, maximizing business process efficiency, and supporting adaptation of strategic goals.</p>
			<p>In the same sense that better information can help companies manage market risks, <em><u>internal controls</u></em> can help companies manage fraud and error risks. Internal controls are activities or tools that</p>

			<h3>Control Frameworks</h3>
			<p>Many frameworks exist that address the various types of risk that external and internal stakeholders face. Four well-known examples are (1) Internal Control&ndash;Integrated Framework and (2) Enterprise Risk Management&ndash;Integrated Framework by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO); (3) Control Objectives for Information and Related Technology (COBIT) by the Information Systems and Audit Control Association (ISACA); and (4) Trust Services by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants (AICPA). The Control section of accounting architecture mirrors the principles of the Trust Services Framework. One reason for this choice is that Trust Services is an accountant's view of system controls.</p>

			<h3>Process Controls</h3>
			<p></p>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h3>External Stakeholders</h3>
			<p>Accounting regulations are often for the purpose of protecting external stakeholders. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles and Generally Accepted Auditing Standards exist to protect external stakeholders from misinformation. <u><em>Sarbanes-Oxley</em></u> (SOX) requires firms to implement internal controls over financial reporting to prevent material misstatements. Additionally, with respect to information systems, business contracts work to prevent breaches of privacy, data loss, and system unavailability. As a result, compliance (one of the blocks in the foundation of the arch) often requires the implementation of controls, regardless of whether the system could function without them.</p>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h3>SOX</h3>
			<p>In response to the wide-spread calamities associated with the more extensive accounting frauds of the late 90's and early 2000's, Congress passed the Sarbanes-Oxley act of 2002 to introduce additional compliance requirements for firms and auditors in order to protect shareholders from accounting errors and fraud. SOX sections 302 and 404 require public firms to implement internal controls and to include an assessment of those internal controls in the annual audit.</p>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h3>Internal Stakeholders</h3>
			<p>Although regulations and contracts are less often designed to protect internal stakeholders, managers and other decision makers within the firm also benefit from controls. Controls reduce the likelihood of misinformation, which would lead to incorrect strategic decisions, and they protect the confidentiality of trade secrets. Because internal stakeholders are the biggest &ldquo;customer&rdquo; of the information system, protecting them from risks becomes a primary goal of information system controls. Additionally, because firms can face serious consequences from external stakeholders in the event of a breach or outage, internal stakeholders also benefit from controls that protect the firm from litigation.</p>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h3>Cost-Benefit Analysis</h3>
			<p>The benefit of a control implementation is the reduction in either the <u><em>likelihood</em></u> of or <u><em>exposure</em></u> to problems. Likelihood is the probability of a problem, and exposure is the dollar loss from litigation, fines, lost business, cost of restoring a system and its data, etc., should a problem occur. Preventive controls can lower the likelihood of a problem, and detective and corrective controls can reduce the exposure (i.e., make a problem less bad or fix a problem more quickly). Any implementation of controls is costly, and although 100% prevention would be the best, the cost is prohibitive. As a result, the only option is a combination of all three types: preventing what can be prevented and detecting and correcting what cannot be prevented.</p>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h3>Segregation of Duties</h3>
			<p>Segregation of duties discourages the assignment of multiple incompatible duties to the same individual. General guidelines for identifying incompatible duties include:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>Authorization for a transaction should be separate from the processing of a transaction. For example, a sales person should not be able to authorize sale of inventory on credit and process the sales transaction. This prevents that creation of fraudulent transactions.</li>
				<li>Custody of assets should be separate from record-keeping. For example, the raw materials store should not be responsible for maintaining records of the levels of raw materials. This prevents asset theft.</li>
			</ol>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h3>Supervision</h3>
			<p>Segregation of duties is an excellent tool for discouraging fraud by requiring individuals to collude in order to succeed in performing and concealing the act. However, sometimes this tool is not available either because the number of available employees is too small and employees need to assume incompatible duties or because a single duty is risky (e.g., unloading inventory from a truck before it is counted or opening envelopes of cash in the mail room). In these situations, supervision is a second-best alternative.</p>

			<h3>Trust Services</h3>

				<div class="flex-item override"><img src="../images/trust-services.png" alt="Trust Services Framework" style="max-width: 300px"/></div>
				<div class="flex-item" style="max-width: 70%">
					<p>Trust Services has a foundation and four pillars:</p>
					<ul>
						<li><u><em>Security</em></u> protects against unauthorized access.</li>
						<li><u><em>Availability</em></u> prevents data loss and system downtime.</li>
						<li><u><em>Processing integrity</em></u> preserves data integrity.</li>
						<li><u><em>Confidentiality</em></u> and <u><em>privacy</em></u> maintain secrets. Because of their similarity, these two occupy the same block in the Architecture.</li>
					</ul>
				</div>
			</div>

		<section>
			<h3>Accounting Tie-in</h3>
			<p>Internal controls and IT controls are important parts of an accountant's focus. This is especially true since SOX. The AICPA has created the Trust Services Framework to address the need for IT controls in order to prevent, detect, and correct fraud, misstatements in financial reports, data loss, system downtime, etc. External stakeholders are an important set of beneficiaries of these controls, but internal stakeholders also benefit because controls prevent fraud and misinformation. Because the Control section is based on the Trust Services Framework, the accounting tie-in is apparent.</p>
