			<h3>Accounting Architecture</h3>
			<div class="flex-row">

				<div class="flex-item" style="max-width: 65%">
					<p>The Services block of the Architecture is the final block in the Technology leg. It comprises networking and cloud computing. In a nutshell, Services rely on the same technologies as the Hardware, Software, and Storage blocks, but in a networked environment. This is the environment in which our connected devices primarily function.</p>
				</div>
			</div>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h3>A Brief History</h3>
			<p>Historically, individual computers were <u><i>thin clients</i></u>&mdash;dumb terminals&mdash;that allowed for use of <u><i>server-side</i></u> software run on a centralized server. Server hardware was large and expensive, and in order to use that hardware efficiently, multiple dumb terminals shared the computing power. As processing power became less expensive, manufacturers created personal computers&mdash;<u><i>fat clients</i></u> or smart terminals&mdash;that could function independently using <u><i>client-side</i></u> software. Desktops and laptop computers continue to follow this model, but with the advent of the Internet and the sharp reduction in data transmission costs, we have also readopted the original model of servers and thin clients by using computing devices that derive their main functionality from Web servers.</p>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h3>What is a Cloud?</h3>
			<p><u><i>Cloud computing</i></u> is the buzz word for the current server-client model, in which all computing devices are connected to the Internet virtually all of the time. Although the term may seem nebulous&mdash;no pun intended&mdash;it simply means that the applications, storage, and processing power used by a computing device are in a remote physical location on a server, instead of on the local device. The cloud computing model is consistent with the current line of thin client hardware, such as smartphones and tablets, but it is inconsistent with continued reliance on high-powered workstations. One explanation for this is that users seem unwilling to abandon client-side applications completely, perhaps out of the desire to have some independence from the Internet. Even mobile device users prefer to have a library of client-side software.</p>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h3>Server Clusters</h3>
			<p>Parallel computing involves including multiple CPUs or CPU cores on the same motherboard. This is the standard for most computing devices today. <u><i>Distributed computing</i></u>, on the other hand, involves combining multiple computers together in a cluster to share a processing task. Any computer, even a tiny SBC, can play the role of the server in a cloud, but the demands placed on a cloud (e.g., think about the number of users watching Netflix simultaneously) frequently exceeds the abilities of a single computer. Many clouds are supported by a server cluster, not a single server.</p>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h3>Mainframes</h3>
			<div class="flex-row">
				<div class="flex-item override"><img src="../images/mainframe.jpg" alt="Mainframe" style="max-height: 500px"/></div>
				<div class="flex-item" style="max-width: 60%">
					<p>In the old server-client model, the servers were called mainframes. Today, mainframes still exist as giant server-rack-sized computers. Mainframes have begun to replace lower-powered servers in larger clouds that utilize hundreds of clustered servers. One mainframe can have the processing power of as many as 200+ individual servers at a fraction of the hardware cost.</p>
				</div>
			</div>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h3>Networks</h3>
			<p>Computing devices access these servers by virtue of networks. <i><u>Local area networks</u></i> (LANs) connect devices in the same geographical location, such as a residence or office, whereas <u><i>wide area networks</i></u> (WANs), such as the Internet, connect devices in different locations. WANs allow devices to access the World Wide Web, which is nothing other than data that is stored on servers in various remote locations.</p>
			<p>LANs use <u><i>routers</i></u> and <u><i>switches</i></u> to connect devices to each other with Category 5E and 6 (Ethernet) cables and wireless fidelity (Wi-Fi). <u><i>Modems</i></u>, or radios, connected to Internet Service Providers (ISPs) by coaxial cable, phone lines, satellite, cell towers, and fiber optics, allow devices to connect to a WAN.</p>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h3>TCP/IP</h3>
			<p>The <u><i>Internet protocol suite</i></u> is the set of protocols currently used to allow network devices to communicate with each other. The two most important protocols are the Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) and the Internet Protocol (IP), hence the common name for the protocol suite: TCP/IP. The Internet Protocol dictates the form of the network address (i.e., IP address) issued to a computer's network interface card (NIC). Each NIC also has a unique media access control (MAC) address, which is essentially the NIC hardware's serial number, although it can be changed (i.e., masked) with the correct software.</p>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h3>IPv4 and IPv6</h3>
			<p>The Internet protocol has two common versions. IPv4 has been the standard since 1983. It uses 4 three-digit numbers, each within the range from 0 to 255, to identify a unique network address (e.g., 192.168.001.010). This allows for just over 4 billion addresses. Because of the drastic increase in network devices, almost all available IPv4 addresses are in use. In order to address this shortage of available addresses, LANs create sub-networks so that the network devices within the LAN can use the same addresses as devices on other LANs. When communicating with the WAN, devices on a LAN all share the same WAN address. The Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) has also addressed the shortage of IP addresses by introducing IPv6 with many more IP addresses. Unfortunately, many modems, ISPs, and Web sites have not yet begun to support IPv6.</p>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h3>Ports</h3>
			<p>In addition to an IP address, each NIC also has 131,072 ports or sockets: 65,536 TCP ports and 65,536 UDP ports. These ports direct network traffic. Each port allows for a single stream of network traffic to or from a NIC, in the same sense that a physical port allows one ship to load or unload cargo at a time. Services listen (i.e., receive network communication) and transmit (i.e., send network communication) via their assigned ports. Many services run on pre-determined ports. For example, Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP), one protocol for making Internet phone calls, frequently uses UDP port 5060; Web servers (HTTP) often use TCP port 80; and the Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP) uses TCP port 25 to send email.</p>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h3>DNS</h3>
			<p>Closely related to the Internet Protocol address is the Domain Name System (DNS). Each file in the World Wide Web has a unique Uniform Resource Locator (URL). This URL combines the address of the host (i.e., the server where the content is stored) and the path to the specific file. It is not feasible to remember the IP addresses of Internet hosts, but it is easy to remember hostnames. DNS servers store an index that pairs hostnames with IP addresses (e.g., google.com with 216.058.218.110) so that Web content is findable by hostname:en.wikipedia.org and path:/wiki/Main_Page without needing to remember the IP address.</p>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h3>Transfer Protocols</h3>
			<p>One additional component of a URL is the scheme, or transfer protocol. The most popular transfer protocol is the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP), which is used to serve Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) documents. The File Transfer Protocol (FTP) is one protocol used to transfer files to and from a file server. Multiple other, less-common schema exist, but these two represent the vast majority of Web URLs.</p>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h3>Public Clouds</h3>
			<p>The concepts of cloud computing and WAN and LAN networks create an important dichotomy for cloud computing. <u><i>Public clouds</i></u> are servers that are hosted by third parties and made available through Internet (i.e., WAN) access. The two most well-known public clouds are Amazon AWS and Microsoft Azure, but other popular offerings exist, such as Google Cloud Computing and Rackspace. The benefit of public clouds is the outsourced responsibility for purchasing and maintaining server and network hardware. Public cloud providers then rent space on their servers to customers.</p>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h3>Private Clouds</h3>
			<p>However, not everyone is interested in outsourcing the IT function. As a result, <u><i>private clouds</i></u> have become increasingly popular. Private clouds are servers that are hosted on the company's own LAN. The company is responsible for purchasing and maintaining all hardware, but with that responsibility comes greater control and flexibility. Although any server-based computing can constitute cloud computing, some software offerings focus specifically on private cloud computing. The three most well-known solutions are OpenStack, CloudStack, and ownCloud. (ownCloud began as a residential-grade private cloud with an email server, file server, and calendar server, but thanks to collaboration with CERN, it can now scale up to handle vast corporate clouds.)</p>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h3>Enterprise Resource Planning</h3>
			<p><u><i>Enterprise Resource Planning</i></u> (ERP) is an early example of cloud computing. The goal of ERP systems was to have centralized data stores, as well as end-user applications and data entry systems with a uniform appearance, for tracking business and accounting data. Oracle and SAP are prominent vendors in this arena, and Peoplesoft had been prior to its acquisition by Oracle. Companies hastily adopted ERPs in the 1990s in the hope that they would increase profitability. Unfortunately, the difficulty of implementation paired with the rigidity of the software&mdash;ERPs expected uniform business process, which is not a realistic requirement&mdash;rendered several implementations costly (&gt;$100 million) and useless. Despite this fact, many ERP systems are still in use today.</p>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h3>Open Source in the Cloud</h3>
			<p>All prominent private cloud offerings are open source. In fact, open source software dominates cloud computing. Ubuntu Linux is the number one operating system for the cloud&mdash;not the number one Linux distribution, the number one operating system&mdash;even on Microsoft's Azure platform, and the most popular databases in the cloud are open source. The primary reason for the popularity of open source private clouds is customizability. Firms have unique processes with unique informational needs, and they want to be able to customize the information system to meet their unique needs. That is why private clouds thrive while ERP adoption diminishes.</p>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h3>Aside: Monetizing Open Source</h3>
			<p>Recent news provides a convenient opportunity to explain how to make money with open source software. Microsoft has announced that it will port SQL Server to Linux. (To port means to make a software originally designed for one operating system or CPU architecture available on another operating system or CPU.) Although Microsoft would prefer users run Windows Server, users prefer Linux. As a result, Microsoft supports Linux on its Azure cloud platform, and if their users prefer Linux, making SQL Server available for Linux can make SQL Server more attractive, as well. Microsoft uses open source Linux to make money from Azure and SQL Server which, despite being available on Linux, remains closed source.</p>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h3>Cloud is a Service</h3>
			<p>This block in the Architecture is named Services because the premise behind cloud computing is to provide computing &ldquo;as a service,&rdquo; meaning that the CPU, RAM, storage, networking, and software on a server or servers are made available (or served) to end-user computing devices, as needed. Service in this sense has the same meaning as service in our earlier operating system discussion of servers and daemons: they provide computer functionality as a service.</p>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h3>Service Levels</h3>
			<div class="flex-row">

				<div class="flex-item" style="max-width: 50%">
					<p>In addition to different types of clouds (public, private, or hybrid, which is a combination of public and private), the <u><i>service level</i></u> can also differ. Traditionally, three service levels existed: <u><i>Infrastructure as a Service</i></u> (IaaS), <u><i>Platform as a Service</i></u> (PaaS), and <u><i>Software as a Service</i></u> (SaaS), but newer alternatives to these have emerged.</p>
				</div>
			</div>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h3>IaaS and PaaS</h3>
			<p>Many corporate-grade clouds provide Infrastructure as a Service. This service level usually involves providing one or more <u><i>virtual machines</i></u>. IaaS is essentially a replacement for a physical server or workstation. It also provides the user with the most flexibility of the three service levels.</p>
			<p>Platform as a Service is more difficult to understand. It usually includes a database, a development environment, and one or more engines, which is code necessary to execute software applications (e.g., a Java engine can execute Java code). The primary role of PaaS is for software development and testing.</p>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h3>Virtualization</h3>
			<p><u><i>Virtualization</i></u> allows software to assume the role of hardware. Instead of a kernel communicating directly with the computer hardware, a virtualized operating system sits in a virtual machine, and its kernel communicates with a <u><i>hypervisor</i></u> which communicates with the computer hardware. The underlying system is the <u><i>host</i></u>, and the virtualized system is the <u><i>guest</i></u>. Virtualization allows for sharing computer hardware with multiple operating systems.</p>
			<div class="override"><img src="../images/hypervisor.png" alt="Hypervisor"/></div>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h3>SaaS</h3>
			<p>Software as a Service is the service level with which end users are most familiar, even if they are not familiar with the term. The World Wide Web is essentially a combination of SaaS offerings. Netflix, Google Docs, YouTube, Instagram, Facebook, Twitter, and other social media interfaces, and even online email inboxes and search engines are examples of Software as a Service. Interestingly, Netflix uses Amazon AWS as an IaaS to host their video platform, which they provide as a SaaS.</p>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h3>Other-aaS</h3>
			<p>Several newer service levels provide functionality previously not available as a service. Two popular examples are <u><i>Database as a Service</i></u> and <u><i>Container as a Service</i></u>. Some companies wish to host their own online applications in-house but decide to outsource the database functionality because of the high demand frequent online transactions common to Big Data and eCommerce place on the database server. DBaaS is a convenient solution for these companies.</p>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h3>Containerization</h3>
			<div class="flex-row">
				<div class="flex-item" style="max-width: 62%">
					<p><u><i>Containerization</i></u> is a newer alternative to virtualization. Virtualization shares computer hardware across a number of virtual machines containing full operating systems. Containerization shares one operating system kernel across a number of containers containing just enough software to perform one function (e.g., run one application). The leaner containers avoid the unnecessary, redundant resource consumption of full guest operating systems.</p>

		</section>

		<section>
			<h3>Containers as a Service</h3>
			<p>CaaS is more efficient than IaaS virtual machines. Virtual machines are entire operating systems, whereas containers share one operating system. Containers generally contain only a single application and perhaps a data store, and they are particularly useful in a cloud environment. Because of this efficiency benefit, Containers as a Service have become increasingly popular for developing and hosting cloud apps. As a result, CaaS has already reduced the frequency of IaaS, and it will likely completely replace PaaS.</p>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h3>Acquisition</h3>
			<p>One of the primary roles of cloud computing for a firm's information system is the ability to collect data. In many cases, this may involve a customer-facing <u><i>online transaction processing</i></u> (OLTP) system. An OLTP system may be a Web server and database to receive customer orders (e.g., Amazon.com), or it might be a container running a Web app so that banking customers can interact with their accounts. Regardless of the specific configuration, the purpose of OLTP is to acquire data for subsequent analysis.</p>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h3>Storage</h3>
			<p>Another role of cloud computing that is strongly related to acquisition is the need to store the collected data. File servers (e.g., FTP servers), which are cloud-based shared file systems, and database servers, which are cloud-based shared RDBMSs or NoSQL databases, can store data acquired by an OLTP and make it available to multiple users and roles, as necessary.</p>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h3>IoT</h3>
			<p>A newer manifestation of cloud computing is the <u><i>Internet of Things</i></u>. Just like &ldquo;cloud computing&rdquo; and &ldquo;data analytics&rdquo;, this term has become a buzz word, but the underlying concept is quite straightforward. Historically, the premise of the Internet was that users access remote content directly. However, as the number of connected devices and the availability of networks have increased and the cost of data transmission has decreased, connected devices (i.e., smart devices) have begun to communicate with each other without human interaction. For example, a smart thermostat may receive temperature data from a weather station and turn on the air conditioning, or a smart automobile may send diagnostic statistics to the manufacturer to predict maintenance needs. Much of Big Data is the data that these IoT devices generate.</p>

		<section>
			<h3>Accounting Tie-in</h3>
			<p>Data is everything to accountants, and in our current connected world, systems must be available to receive external data, storage systems must be able to preserve vital data, and accountants must have the analytical skills necessary to interpret the data for internal and external decision-makers. According to E&amp;Y, the tax function has become the largest consumer of data in the enterprise. Two reasons for this trend are (1) data analysis enables taxes to drive corporate strategy and (2) tax authorities have begun to demand increased granularity in tax disclosure (i.e., underlying transactional data instead of summary figures). A well-designed cloud captures transactional data and makes in available for analysis and reporting.</p>
