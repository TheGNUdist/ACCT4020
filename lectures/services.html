				<div class="flex-item" style="max-width: 65%">
					<p>The Services block of the Architecture is the final block in the Technology leg. It comprises networking and cloud computing. In a nutshell, Services relies on the same technologies as the Hardware, Software, and Storage blocks, but Services uses these in a remote, and not a local, environment.</p>
				</div>
			</div>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h3>Familiarity</h3>
			<p>Because of the prevalence of digital devices, most students already rely on many of the technologies previously discussed throughout this course. With our connected lifestyle, this is especially true of network technologies. As a result, much of this discussion is an explanation of technologies, with which we are all already familiar, even if the technical terms are not.</p>
		</section>
		
		<section>
			<h3>A Brief History</h3>
			<p>Historically, individual computers were <u><i>thin clients</i></u>&mdash;dumb terminals&mdash;that allowed for use of <u><i>server-side</i></u> software on a centralized server. Server hardware was large and expensive, and in order to use that hardware efficiently, multiple dumb terminals shared the computing power. As processing power became less expensive, manufacturers created personal computers&mdash;<u><i>fat clients</i></u> or smart terminals&mdash;that could function independently using <u><i>client-side</i></u> software. To some extent, desktop and laptop computers continue to follow this model.</p>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h3>Going Online</h3>
			<p>With the advent of the Internet and the sharp reduction in data transmission cost, we have now returned to the original model of servers and thin clients, but we have added an additional concept. Applying terminology of today to the original server-client relationship, these dumb terminals communicated with their server using a <i><u>local area network</u></i> (LAN), which connects devices in the same geographical location, such as a residence or office. A <u><i>wide area network</i></u> (WAN), such as the Internet, connects devices in different locations. This allows for access to the World Wide Web, which is fundamentally data that is stored on servers in various remote locations.</p>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h3>LAN Hardware</h3>
			<p>A local area network uses <u><i>routers</i></u> and <u><i>switches</i></u>. The differences between these are beyond our purview, but briefly, a switch allows network traffic to flow to multiple different devices, whereas a router creates a smaller network within a larger network and directs traffic between the smaller and larger networks. Category 5, 5E and 6 (Ethernet) cables and wireless fidelity (Wi-Fi) connect individual devices to the LAN.</p>

		</section>

		<section>
			<h3>WAN Hardware</h3>
			<p>Modems, also referred to as radios, allow devices and LANs to access a WAN.  Internet Service Providers (ISPs) use coaxial cable, phone lines, satellite, cell towers, and fiber optics to allow individual residences and business access to a WAN, such as the Internet. Because the Internet encompasses multiple continents, undersea fiber optics are necessary to create the WAN interconnectivity that we take for granted.</p>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h3>TCP/IP</h3>
			<p>The Internet protocol suite is the set of protocols currently used to allow network devices to communicate. The two most important protocols are the Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) and the Internet Protocol (IP), hence the common name for the protocol suite: TCP/IP. The Internet Protocol dictates the form of the network address (i.e., IP address) issued to a computer's network interface card (NIC). Each NIC also has a unique media access control (MAC) address, which is essentially the NIC's serial number.</p>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h3>IPv4</h3>
			<p>The Internet protocol has two common versions. IPv4 has been the standard since 1983 and is still in use today. IPv4 uses 4 three-digit numbers to identify a unique network address (e.g., 192.168.001.010). This allows for just over 4 billion addresses available to the Internet. Unfortunately, because of the drastic increase in network devices, almost all available IPv4 addresses are in use. In order to address this shortage of available addresses, LANs create sub-networks so that the network devices within the LAN can use the same addresses as devices on other LANs.</p>
		</section>
		
		<section>
			<h3>IPv6</h3>
			<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/-Uwjt32NvVA?rel=0&amp;showinfo=0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>
			<p>The Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) has also addressed the shortage of IP addresses by introducing IPv6. Unfortunately, IPv6 is not yet widely adopted. Many modems and ISPs have not yet begun to support this protocol, and only some Web servers have IPv6 enabled.</p>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h3>Ports</h3>
			<p>In addition to an IP address, each NIC also has 131,072 ports or sockets: 65,536 TCP ports and 65,536 UDP ports. Both TCP and UDP are part of the TCP/IP suite, and their differences are too technical for our purposes. The ports direct network traffic. Each port allows for a single stream of network traffic to or from a NIC. The first 1,024 ports in both protocols are reserved for system processes that provide network services.</p>
		</section>
		
		<section>
			<h3>DNS</h3>
			<p>Closely related to the Internet Protocol address is the Domain Name System (DNS). Each file in the World Wide Web has a unique Uniform Resource Locator (URL). This URL combines the address of the host (i.e., the server where the content is stored) and the path to the specific file. However, it is not feasible to remember the IP addresses of Internet hosts, but it is easy to remember hostnames. DNS servers store an index that pairs hostnames with IP addresses (e.g., google.com with 216.058.218.110) so that Web content is findable by hostname:en.wikipedia.org and path:/wiki/Main_Page without needing to remember the IP address.</p>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h3>Transfer Protocols</h3>
			<p>One additional component of a URL is the scheme, which I will call the transfer protocol. The most popular transfer protocol is the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP), which is used to serve Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) documents. The File Transfer Protocol (FTP) is used to transfer arbitrary files. The Mailto scheme allows for creating hyperlinks that include email addresses. Other schema exist, but they are much less common.</p>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h3>Always Online</h3>
			<p>The current status quo is for all of our devices to be connected to the Internet at all times. This somewhat opposes the premise of the personal computer, but it is perfectly in line with the idea behind the current generation of thin clients, such as smartphones, tablets, and Chromebooks. Personal computers commonly have higher processing power than thin clients to accommodate continued reliance on client-side applications, such as games, statistical analysis software, games, video and audio editing software&mdash;have I mentioned games&mdash;etc.</p>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h3>Not Without Offline</h3>
			<p>Even thin clients have considerable processing power for two reasons. First, consumers are not yet willing to accept a computer that cannot function offline, so even thin clients now have client-side applications&mdash;think of mobile apps, such as, dare I say it, games&mdash;and second, the consumption of server-side content currently requires significant client-side processing power. For example, simply keeping 10 browser tabs open requires approximately 2 GB of RAM.</p>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h3>Not Really Client Side</h3>
			<p>It is also worth mentioning that even client-side applications today rarely constitute <i>client-side-only</i> applications. Because computers are effectively always online, these client-side applications can communicate with remote servers to provide additional content, periodic updates, multiplayer functionality&mdash;yes, I mean games, again&mdash;or syncing between devices.</p>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h3>What is a Cloud?</h3>
			<p>Cloud computing is currently a buzz word, but it is not a new, nor is it a complicated concept. It essentially means server-based, as opposed to client-based, computing, just as in the dumb terminal days of yore. The Internet as a WAN is a cloud because it relies on server-based computing, although <em>servers</em>-based might be a more appropriate term. Similarly, a LAN can also host a cloud if the LAN uses server-based computing. The original server-dumb terminal environment was a LAN-based cloud, except that no one called it that back then.</p>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h3>Cluster Computing</h3>
			<p>Parallel computing involves including multiple CPUs or CPU cores on the same motherboard. This is the standard for most computing devices today. Distributed computing, on the other hand, involves combining multiple computers together in a cluster to share a processing task. Any computer, even a tiny SBC, can play the role of the server in a cloud, but the demands placed on a cloud (e.g., think about the number of users watching Netflix simultaneously) frequently exceeds the abilities of a single computer. Many clouds are supported by a server cluster, not a single server.</p>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h3>Mainframes</h3>
			<div class="flex-row">
  		  <div class="flex-item override"><img src="../../images/mainframe.jpg" alt="Mainframe" style="max-height: 500px"/></div>
				<div class="flex-item" style="max-width: 60%">
					<p>In the old server-client model, the servers were called mainframes. Today, mainframes still exist as giant server-rack-sized computers. Mainframes have begun to replace lower-powered servers in larger clouds that utilize hundreds of clustered servers. One mainframe can have the processing power of as many as 200+ individual servers at a fraction of the hardware cost.</p>
				</div>
			</div>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h3>Public Clouds</h3>
			<p>The concept of WAN clouds and LAN clouds creates an important dichotomy for cloud computing. <u><i>Public clouds</i></u> are servers that are hosted by third parties and made available through Internet (i.e., WAN) access. The two most well-known public clouds are Amazon AWS and Microsoft Azure, but other popular offerings exist, such as Google Cloud Computing and Rackspace. The benefit of public clouds is the outsourced responsibility for purchasing and maintaining server and network hardware. Public cloud providers then rent space on their servers to customers.</p>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h3>Private Clouds</h3>
			<p>However, not everyone is interested in outsourcing the IT function. As a result, <u><i>private clouds</i></u> have become increasingly popular. Private clouds are servers that are hosted on the company's own LAN. The company is responsible for purchasing and maintaining all hardware, but with that responsibility comes greater control and flexibility. Although any server-based computing can constitute cloud computing, some specific software offerings focus specifically on private cloud computing. The three most well-known solutions are OpenStack, CloudStack, and ownCloud. (ownCloud began as a residential-grade private cloud offering an email server, file server, and calendar server, but thanks to collaboration with CERN, it can now scale up to handle vast corporate clouds.)</p>
		</section>

		<section>
		  <h3>Enterprise Resource Planning</h3>
		  <p><u><i>Enterprise Resource Planning</i></u> (ERP) is an early example of cloud computing. The goal of ERP systems was to have centralized data stores, as well as end-user applications and data entry systems with a uniform appearance, for tracking business and accounting data. Oracle and SAP are prominent vendors in this arena, and Peoplesoft had been prior to its acquisition by Oracle. Companies hastily adopted ERPs in the 1990s in the hope that they would increase profitability. Unfortunately, the difficulty of implementation paired with the rigidity of the software&mdash;ERPs expected uniform business process, which is not a realistic requirement&mdash;rendered several implementations costly (&gt;$100 million) and useless. Despite this fact, many ERP systems are still in use today.</p>
		</section>
		
		<section>
			<h3>Open Source in the Cloud</h3>
			<p>All prominent private cloud offerings are open source. In fact, open source software dominates cloud computing. Ubuntu Linux is the number one operating system for the cloud&mdash;not the number one Linux distribution, the number one operating system&mdash;even on Microsoft's Azure platform, and the most popular databases in the cloud are open source. The primary reason for the popularity of open source private clouds is customizability. Firms have unique processes with unique informational needs, and they want to be able to customize the information system to meet their unique needs. That is why private clouds thrive while ERP adoption diminishes.</p>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h3>Aside: Monetizing Open Source</h3>
			<p>Recent news provides a convenient opportunity to explain how to make money with open source software. Microsoft has recently announced that it will port SQL Server to Linux. (To port means to make a software originally designed for one operating system or CPU architecture available on another operating system or CPU.) Although Microsoft would prefer users run Windows Server, users prefer Linux servers. As a result, Microsoft supports Linux on its Azure cloud platform, and if their users prefer Linux, making SQL Server available for Linux can make SQL Server more attractive, as well. Microsoft uses open source Linux to make money from Azure and SQL Server, which, despite being available on Linux, remains closed source.</p>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h3>Cloud is a Service</h3>
			<p>This block in the Architecture is named Services because the premise behind cloud computing is to provide computing &ldquo;as a service,&rdquo; meaning that the CPU, RAM, storage, networking, and software on a server or servers are made available (or served) to end-user computing devices, as needed. Service in this sense has the same meaning as service in our earlier operating system discussion of servers and daemons: they provide computer functionality as a service.</p>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h3>Service Levels</h3>
			<div class="flex-row">
  		  <!--CC BY-SA 3.0 Attribution: Sam Johnston-->
  		  <div class="flex-item override"><img src="../../images/cloud.png" alt="Cloud Computing"/></div>
				<div class="flex-item" style="max-width: 50%">
					<p>In addition to different types of clouds (public, private, or hybrid, which is a combination of public and private), the <u><i>service level</i></u> can also differ. Traditionally, three service levels existed: <u><i>Infrastructure as a Service</i></u> (IaaS), <u><i>Platform as a Service</i></u> (PaaS), and <u><i>Software as a Service</i></u> (SaaS), but newer alternatives to these have emerged.</p>
				</div>
			</div>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h3>IaaS and PaaS</h3>
			<p>Many corporate-grade clouds provide Infrastructure as a Service. This service level usually involves providing one or more virtual machines. IaaS is essentially a replacement for a physical server or workstation. It also provides the user with the most flexibility of the three service levels.</p>
			<p>Platform as a Service is more difficult to understand. It usually includes a database, a development environment, and one or more engines, which is code necessary to execute software applications (e.g., a Java engine can execute Java code). The primary role of PaaS is for software development and testing.</p>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h3>SaaS</h3>
			<p>Software as a Service is the service level with which end users are most familiar, although they generally would not use that term. The World Wide Web is essentially a combination of SaaS offerings. Netflix, Google Docs, YouTube, Instagram, Facebook, Twitter, and other social media interfaces, and even online email inboxes and search engines are examples of Software as a Service. Interestingly, Netflix uses Amazon AWS as IaaS to host their video platform, which they provide as SaaS.</p>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h3>Other-aaS</h3>
			<p>Several newer service levels provide functionality that is beyond the scope of this course, but two (DBaaS and CaaS) are worth mentioning. Some companies wish to host their own online applications in-house but decide to outsource the database functionality because of the high demand frequent online transactions common to Big Data and eCommerce place on the database server. DBaaS is a convenient solution for these companies.</p>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h3>Virtualization</h3>
			<p><u><i>Virtualization</i></u> provides another method for using hardware more efficiently. Instead of the kernel communicating directly with the hardware, the kernel sits in a <u><i>virtual machine</i></u> and communicates with a <u><i>hypervisor</i></u> that imitates the computer hardware. The underlying system is the <u><i>host</i></u>, and the virtualized system is the <u><i>guest</i></u>.</p>
			<div class="override"><img src="../../images/hypervisor.png" alt="Hypervisor"/></div>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h3>Containerization</h3>
			<p><u><i>Containerization</i></u> is a newer and slightly more complicated alternative to virtualization that again increases efficient use of hardware resources. Because a full operating system resides in the virtual machine, any guest operating system functionality that is not needed wastes resources. A container strips out all of the unnecessary components of the guest operating system and leaves just enough tools to perform one predetermined task in the spirit of the Unix philosophy. Additionally, instead of the guest having its own kernel, it shares a kernel with the host.</p>

			<img src="../../images/containerization.jpg" alt="Containerization" style="max-height: 175px"/>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h3>Containers</h3>
			<p>Containers are more efficient that IaaS virtual machines. Virtual machines are entire operating systems, whereas containers are isolated but share one operating system. Containers generally contain only a single application and perhaps a data store, and they are particularly useful in a cloud environment as an alternative to IaaS. Because of this efficiency benefit, Containers as a Service have become increasingly popular for developing and hosting cloud apps. As a result, CaaS has already reduced the frequency of IaaS, and it will likely completely replace PaaS.</p>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h3>Big Picture</h3>
			<div class="flex-row">
				<div class="flex-item"><img src="../../images/data-warehouse.jpg" alt="Data Warehouse" style="max-width: 350px"/></div>
				<div class="flex-item" style="max-width: 60%">
					<p>By combining many of these services together, we can create a hypothetical cloud. In this image, we can see the information life cycle at work. First, externally facing and department-specific databases support specialized data entry. Second, one large-scale data store receives a converted copy of the data from each first-stage database and stores it in a centralized location. Third, departments receive curated data back for analysis.</p>
				</div>
			</div>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h3>OLTP</h3>
			<div class="flex-row">
				<div class="flex-item"><img src="../../images/data-warehouse.jpg" alt="Data Warehouse" style="max-width: 350px"/></div>
				<div class="flex-item" style="max-width: 60%">
					<p>The first set of systems, labeled Operational Systems, receives data from external sources. These are frequently <u><i>Online Transaction Processing</i></u> (OLTP) systems because they receive data (e.g., customer orders, market prices, and other forms of Big Data) in real-time. Amazon's sales order interface would be an example of an OLTP system. These systems require fast, scalable data stores, so NoSQL is a popular solution.</p>
				</div>
			</div>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h3>Integration Layer</h3>
			<div class="flex-row">
				<div class="flex-item"><img src="../../images/data-warehouse.jpg" alt="Data Warehouse" style="max-width: 350px"/></div>
				<div class="flex-item" style="max-width: 60%">
					<p>Because the OLTP systems can have different configurations, the data from each may not be in a uniform format. Before archiving the data, conversion is likely necessary. (This may be in addition to any conversion that is necessary prior to initial entry into the OLTP system.) The integration layer, or staging area, provides a intermediate store when data is cleaned and converted.</p>
				</div>
			</div>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h3>Not Fun, But Necessary</h3>
			<p>Expertise in data analytics is currently a desirable skill, but one of the precursors to useful data analytics is good data. One of the purposes for teaching the information life cycle is to provide you with the awareness of the need to design systems that will ensure good data for analytics, but for pre-existing systems, sometimes the only solution is to take the data as given. As a result, data specialists confess that a large part of their job is cleaning data (e.g., looking for likely errors, finding duplicate data, matching records in one store with the records in another). It is not fun, but it is necessary.</p>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h3>Data Warehouse and Marts</h3>
			<div class="flex-row">
				<div class="flex-item"><img src="../../images/data-warehouse.jpg" alt="Data Warehouse" style="max-width: 350px"/></div>
				<div class="flex-item" style="max-width: 60%">
					<p>The <u><i>data warehouse</i></u> receives clean data from staging and stores it. <u><i>Data marts</i></u> are small warehouses that store department-specific data for analysis. The warehouse and marts serve two special purposes. First, they allow OLTP systems to remain unencumbered when performing resource-intensive data analysis. Second, they can store the results of OLAP and MapReduce in addition to the original data.</p>
				</div>
			</div>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h3>Pre-Calculation</h3>
			<p>Traditional OLAP (i.e., multidimensional online analytical processing) takes large amounts of data and creates an OLAP hypercube, which is essentially a multidimensional table, with statistics aggregated along number of parameters (e.g., year, market segment, department, country, etc.). Similarly, MapReduce combines data records according to pre-determined criteria and calculates statistics. Once these are complete, decision-makers can view the statistics, frequently using visualization tools, and draw conclusions. The pre-calculation can take a long time, so it is necessary to store the results of these procedures for subsequent use. The data warehouse is responsible for storing these statistics.</p>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h3>In Or Out?</h3>
			<p>At a recent meeting of the American Taxation Association, representatives from E&amp;Y's tax practice talked about data analytics and tax planning and compliance. One individual stated that because of the increase in real-time analytical tools, data warehouses were no longer necessary. Given the roles that they play, I find this a bold statement. Later on in the presentation, it appeared that what the individual meant was that real-time analytics had replaced traditional pre-calculations, so it was no longer necessary to store OLAP cubes. I agree that real-time analytics have begun to replace traditional OLAP and MapReduce, but I would not agree that this removes the need for a data warehouse to archive data collected from transactional databases.</p>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h3>Accounting Tie-in</h3>
			<p>Our discussion of networking was primarily to explain the technologies that you rely on each day. In many accounting roles, this information is not directly relevant, but it is useful for accounting architects and IT auditors, who need a deeper understanding of IT. However, the concepts of cloud computing&mdash;public vs. private, service levels, transaction processing systems, and data warehousing&mdash;have broader importance. Data is everything to accountants, and in our current connected world, systems must be available to receive external data, storage systems must be able to preserve vital data, and accountants must have the analytical skills necessary to interpret the data for internal and external decision-makers.</p>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h3>Taxation Tie-in</h3>
			<p>According to E&amp;Y, the tax function has become the largest consumer of data in the enterprise. Two reasons for this trend are (1) data analysis enables taxes to drive corporate strategy and (2) tax authorities have begun to demand increased granularity in tax disclosure (i.e., underlying transactional data instead of summary figures). A well-designed cloud captures transactional data, cleans it, and stores it for the tax function to analyze.</p>
		</section>

		<section>
