			<h2>Introduction to Accounting Architecture</h2>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h3>What Is an Accountant?</h3>
			<p>Accounting textbooks teach us that accounting is the measurement and communication of economic activities. This makes accountants the custodians of business information. Most accounting courses teach regulations to prepare students to become staff accountants or auditors or tax preparers. Although these are valuable skills, the role of information custodianship is much broader than tax returns, journal entries, and ledgers. Information custodianship involves understanding how to create information from the data that financial and non-financial business transactions generate, and accounting employers have begun to realize the need for a broader perspective of the definition of an accountant.</p>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h3>Demanded Competencies</h3>
			<p>What skills have accounting firms requested?</p>
			<ul>
				<li><u><em>Data collection</em></u>: the creation and acquisition of data.</li>
				<li><u><em>Data analytics</em></u>: the discovery of business information.</li>
				<li><u><em>Data visualization</em></u>: the reporting of business information to decision makers.</li>
			</ul>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h3>Information Is Money</h3>
			<p>What has precipitated the desire for these skills? <em>Big Data</em>. The world creates more than 2.5 quintillion bytes of data daily (1 quintillion bytes &asymp; 1 exabyte &asymp; 1 billion gigabytes) and the rate of data creation will continue to grow. More than 90% of all data is less than 5 years old. Understanding this data unlocks insights into customer behavior, economic trends, future strategies, etc.</p>
			<blockquote>He uses his power and wealth to gain information. The more he acquires, the greater his power and wealth.<br>&ndash; Sherlock Holmes on Charles Magnussen</blockquote>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h3>Beyond Data Analytics</h3>
			<p>Data collection and analytics may be highly demanded skills, but information custodianship involves more than these. Custodianship begins with <u><em>systems design</em></u>, which involves the identification of the roles the information system should play, the data the system should collect, and the information or reports the system should generate, as well as the selection of technologies that build an information system to meet specifications.</p>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h3>The Information Era</h3>
			<p>The surge in technological innovation may lead some to believe erroneously that we live in the Technology Era, but the goal of technological innovation is not to serve technology. In other words, technology is not an end to itself. It is a means to an end, specifically a means to the generation of more information. Technology is a mere, albeit important, vessel for the generation of additional information. Make no mistake, we live in the Information Era.</p>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h3>All Types of Information?</h3>
			<p>Business information in an information system extends beyond traditional accounting content. Although the historical belief may have been that accountants should only care about accounting&mdash;to quote The Simpsons: &ldquo;Hey, Surly only looks out for one guy: Surly!&rdquo;&mdash;with the extensive business knowledge accountants have by virtue of their understanding of how to measure economic activities, they should expand their role to act as a custodian of all business information.</p>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h3>Old Meets New</h3>
			<p>Although the idea of systems design and general custodianship of business information is new to the accounting profession, the concept of supporting the information system is not. For years, one of the primary roles of accountants has been to audit IT systems to verify that existing systems meet control objectives to maintain data integrity and prevent unauthorized access. This has both positive and negative consequences. Because accountants have had a limited view of their role in the information system, they have been poorly equipped to serve as IT auditors. As accountants broaden their skills, not only will they be able to fill new and popular data analytics roles, but they will also increase in their ability to perform the more traditional IT audit, and even financial audit, roles.</p>

					<p>The purpose of this course is to train students to become accountants who can fill the spectrum of information custodian roles by explaining what an information system does, what it should be, and how it is controlled. The framework for this instruction is accounting architecture. The idea behind the name is that the framework explains the building blocks of an information system that supplies accounting information.</p>
				</div>
			</div>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h3>Why Architecture?</h3>
			<p>Many disciplines have concepts of the structure, building blocks, and form of a system, and they call these &ldquo;architecture&rdquo; in the same sense that a physical structure has an architecture. Business architecture is the design of business models and activities to fulfill business strategies. Software architecture is the structure and design of computer software. IT/systems architecture is the design of computer systems. Accounting architecture relies heavily on systems architecture, and as such, could be called accounting systems architecture. However, this is too limiting a label. Accounting architecture is the structure of accounting information, as well as the structure of the information system necessary to capture, record, and communicate that information.</p>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h3>Not IT Specialists</h3>
			<p>The purpose of this course is not to encourage students to change their profession or to create accountants who can replace IT staff. Knowledge of accounting architecture creates accountants, or rather accounting architects, who can collaborate with IT staff to create and maintain information systems that will provide the best possible information for decision makers. The goal is to &ldquo;bridge the gap&rdquo; between business specialists and IT specialists. Some have called this practice &ldquo;business-led IT&rdquo; because business specialists lead systems design. I prefer  &ldquo;accounting-led IT&rdquo; to emphasize the importance of accountants with their unique business knowledge collaborating with IT staff.</p>

			<h3>Quotes on Collaboration</h3>
			<blockquote>IT staff must become more business aware and understand how their decisions impact the bottom-line.<br> &ndash; Robert Reeves, CTO, Datical</blockquote>
			<blockquote>IT needs to find individuals who can work effectively with line-of-business teams and transform them to drive value to the enterprise.<br> &ndash; Chris Bedi, CIO, ServiceNow</blockquote>
			<blockquote>[It] is a tough job that balances skills across business, technology, and leadership.<br> &ndash; Mike Macrie, CIO, Land O' Lakes</blockquote>

			<h3>Sections of the Arch</h3>
			<div class="flex-row">
				<div class="flex-item override"><img src="../images/Arch5Color.png" alt="AA Arch" style="max-width: 300px"/></div>
				<div class="flex-item" style="max-width: 65%">
					<p>The arch of the accounting architecture has four sections: Environment, Information, Technology, and Control. The following slides introduce each of these sections, as well as the blocks that these sections comprise.</p>
				</div>
			</div>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h3>Environment</h3>
			<p>The environment is the collection of external and internal forces that affect the business entity and its accounting information. These environmental constructs determine the boundaries of a useful information system:
			<ul style="display: inline-block">
				<li><u><em>Compliance</em></u></li>
				<li><u><em>Business Model</em></u></li>
				<li><u><em>Risk</em></u></li>
			</ul>
			<p>Think of these as the foundation of a house. The foundation is not sufficient to determine the <em>best</em> building schematics, but it can exclude many incompatible blueprints.</p>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h3>Compliance</h3>
			<p>In the first place, <u><em>compliance</em></u> deals with the entity's regulatory environment. The main focus of accounting courses is accounting rules and regulations. Financial accounting, audit, and tax are rules-based, and any useful information system must generate information necessary to comply with these rules (e.g., financial statements, tax forms, etc.). Federal, state, and local laws are also part of the regulatory environment.</p>
			<p>Compliance also addresses contractual relationships with lenders, suppliers, and customers. Although these are not regulatory bodies, they may demand access to certain information or a certain level of security.</p>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h3>Business Model</h3>
			<p>The <u><em>business model</em></u> is the form the business entity takes to achieve its business strategies. This can include the chosen industry to operate in, ownership structure, financing method, investments, etc. The form of the business model is under the purview of business architects. Accountants and information systems specialists report on the chosen business model. As the information system collects data and reports on the existing business model, accountants can provide insights into potential modifications of the current model, as well as entirely new strategies. (Big Data analytics has been particularly useful for divining new business strategies.)</p>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h3>Risk</h3>
			<p>Any business environment contains both <u><em>internal and external risks</em></u>. External risks include general economic conditions, industry competition and developments, availability of financing and financing requirements, litigation, technological developments, and digital threats (e.g., hacking). Internal risks include business expansion, management ability and core competencies, corporate governance and culture, changes in key personnel, resource capacity, fraud, data loss and error, and technological feasibility of business and IT objectives. These risks influence the types of data that the information system should gather and process and, more importantly, also the set of controls the business entity should implement to prevent these risks from threatening profitability.</p>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h3>Information</h3>
			<p>The Information section of the arch comprises three blocks:</p>
			<ol>
				<li><u><em>Creation</em></u>: data collection or acquisition and entry into the system.</li>
				<li><u><em>Use</em></u>: data analysis and reporting.</li>
				<li><u><em>Maintenance</em></u>: data storage and preservation.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>Each of these three blocks contains multiple steps. Together they form the information life cycle (i.e., what the information systems should do). Current employers have focused their attention on data analysis, but although Use is the culminating block of the Information section and the architecture model as a whole, knowledge of data analysis tools is incomplete without an understanding of the data and the process by which it becomes information.</p>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h3>Technology</h3>
			<p>The Technology section comprises four blocks:</p>
			<ol>
				<li><u><em>Hardware</em></u>: the physical components of the information system.</li>
				<li><u><em>Software</em></u>: operating systems and server- and client-side applications.</li>
				<li><u><em>Storage</em></u>: physical and logical data storage.</li>
				<li><u><em>Services</em></u>: networking and cloud computing.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>Whereas the Information section discusses the principles of information, the Technology blocks represent the physical manifestation of the information system (i.e., what the information system should be).</p>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h3>Solutions &ne; Tools</h3>
			<p>It is popular to ask, &ldquo;How can I achieve solution X with tool Y?&rdquo; (e.g., How can I track sales [X] in Microsoft Access [Y]?) This attitude leads to an overly restrictive view of possible solutions to business problems, especially in situations when individuals have familiarity with only a small set of tools (e.g., Y always equals Microsoft Excel). This phenomenon is known as the Law of the Instrument: If all you have is a hammer, every problem looks like a nail. Rephrasing this question and decomposing it into multiple parts&mdash;&ldquo;How can I achieve solution X?&rdquo; and &ldquo;Which tool(s) can best help me to achieve solution X?&rdquo;&mdash;redirects attention away from tools and toward solutions. Because the solution is the actual goal, focusing on solutions instead of tools can result in superior business outcomes.</p>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h3>What About Tools?</h3>
			<p>Even when focusing on solutions, an information system must, in the end, comprise specific technological tools. As a result, a grasp of accounting architecture is incomplete without understanding of some enterprise-grade information system technologies. Although Microsoft Excel and Access, Quickbooks, and the like are popular business tools, they have (severely) limited application toward accounting architecture. Important architecture tools, such as operating systems, data entry and storage solutions, analysis and reporting software, and networking, have much broader applicability and adaptability.</p>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h3>Controls</h3>
			<p>The Controls section also comprises four blocks:</p>
			<ol>
				<li><u><em>Security</em></u>: protecting against unauthorized access.</li>
				<li><u><em>Availability</em></u>: preventing data loss and system downtime.</li>
				<li><u><em>Processing Integrity</em></u>: preventing data errors.</li>
				<li><u><em>Confidentiality</em></u>: safeguarding personal and corporate secrets.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>These four blocks are the AICPA Trust Services Framework. Although many other control frameworks exist, I have selected this because it focuses on data security (i.e., how the system is controlled). With the rise in cybersecurity threats, information security has become increasingly important, and accountants are particularly interested in compliance with good control practices.</p>

			<h3>Architecture Development</h3>
			<p></p>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h3>DevOps</h3>
			<p></p>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h3>Accounting Tie-Ins</h3>
			<p>Some students feel that these IT-related topics are not relevant to them and that they would prefer to focus on accounting regulations. I accept that it is my responsibility to prove otherwise. As a result, in each lecture I will try to include &ldquo;Accounting Tie-in&rdquo; slides in an attempt to emphasize how accounting architecture &ldquo;places the components of the information systems in context with accounting regulations,&rdquo; or in other words, how an accounting architecture principle matters to accountants.</p>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h3>Communication Matters</h3>
			<p>Many accountants, even accounting architects, will not use technical skills on a regular basis. The role of accountants is to collaborate with IT staff on the design, maintenance, and audit of information systems using <em>words</em>. The ability to communicate and collaborate requires familiarity with IT tools, practices, and controls, but it also requires the ability to write and speak clearly with proper spelling and grammar.</p>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h3>Listen to the Man</h3>
			<blockquote>We're always looking for people who can have both a deep technology conversation, as well as a deep business conversation. You need the right blend of those people in your organization. But we also can't forget that technology is hard, and people who are very skilled at technology don't always have an interest in business processes. Having that right mix&mdash;and respecting them both appropriately&mdash;is a responsibility of the CIO and his team.<br> &ndash; Keith Collins, CIO, SAS</blockquote>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h3>The &ldquo;Big&rdquo; Tie-in</h3>
			<p>I developed accounting architecture because employers want accountants with the ability to understand data and audit information systems.</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Two Big 4 accounting firms have proposed additions to the current curriculum covering information system technologies.</li>
				<li>Partners from KPMG and PwC have expressed interest in hiring more accountants with IT knowledge.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Effective Fall 2015, Fogelman offers an additional MS in Accounting track for data analytics, as well as a certificate in Business Intelligence and Analysis. Even if only some students pursue this career path, this modification to the curriculum will improve these individuals' preparation and future opportunities.</p>
