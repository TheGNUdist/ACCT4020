			<h2>Introduction to Accounting Architecture</h2>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h3>What Is an Accountant?</h3>
			<p>Accounting textbooks teach us that accounting is the measurement and communication of economic activities. This makes accountants the custodians of business information. Most accounting courses teach regulations to prepare students to become staff accountants or auditors or tax preparers. Although these are valuable skills, the role of information custodianship is much broader than tax returns, journal entries, and ledgers. Information custodianship involves understanding how to create information from the data that financial and non-financial business transactions generate, and accounting employers have begun to realize the need for a broader perspective of the definition of an accountant.</p>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h3>Demanded Competencies</h3>
			<p>What skills have accounting firms requested?</p>
			<ul>
				<li><u><i>Data collection</i></u>: the creation and acquisition of data.</li>
				<li><u><i>Data analytics</i></u>: the discovery of business information.</li>
				<li><u><i>Data visualization</i></u>: the reporting of business information to decision makers.</li>
			</ul>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h3>Information Is Money</h3>
			<p>What has precipitated the desire for these skills? <i>Big Data</i>. The world creates more than 2.5 quintillion bytes of data daily (1 quintillion bytes &asymp; 1 exabyte &asymp; 1 billion gigabytes) and the rate of data creation will continue to grow. More than 90% of all data is less than 5 years old. Understanding this data unlocks insights into customer behavior, economic trends, future strategies, etc.</p>

			<h3>The Information Era</h3>
			<p>The surge in technological innovation may lead some to believe erroneously that we live in the Technology Era, but the goal of technological innovation is not to serve technology. In other words, technology is not an end to itself. It is a means to an end, specifically a means to the generation of more information. Technology is a mere, albeit important, vessel for the generation of additional information. Make no mistake, we live in the Information Era.</p>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h3>Beyond Data Analytics</h3>
			<p>Data collection and analytics may be highly demanded skills, but information custodianship involves more than these. Custodianship begins with <u><i>system design</i></u>, which involves the identification of the roles the information system should play, the data the system should collect, and the information or reports the system should generate, as well as the selection of technologies that build an information system to meet specifications.</p>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h3>All Types of Information?</h3>
			<p>Business information in an information system extends beyond traditional accounting content. Although the historical belief may have been that accountants should only care about accounting&mdash;to quote The Simpsons: &ldquo;Hey, Surly only looks out for one guy... Surly!&rdquo;&mdash;with the extensive business knowledge accountants have by virtue of their understanding of how to measure economic activities, they should expand their role to act as a custodian of all business information.</p>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h3>Old Meets New</h3>
			<p>Although the idea of system design and general custodianship of business information is new to the accounting profession, the concept of supporting the information system is not. For years, one of the primary roles of accountants has been to audit IT systems to verify that existing systems meet control objectives to maintain data integrity and prevent unauthorized access. This has both positive and negative consequences. Because accountants have had a limited view of their role in the information system, they have been poorly equipped to serve as IT auditors. However, as accountants broaden their skills, not only will they be able fill new and popular data analytics roles, rather they will also increased in their ability to perform the more traditional IT audit, and even financial audit, roles.</p>

			<h3>Accounting Architecture - Teaching the Skills</h3>

					<p>The purpose of this course is to train students to become accountant who can fill the spectrum of information custodian roles by explaining what an information system does, what it should be, and it is controlled. The framework for this instruction is Accounting Architecture. The idea behind the name is that the framework explains the building blocks of an information system that supplies accounting information.</p>
				</div>

			<h3>The Elephant in the Room</h3>
			<p>The title of this course in the catalog is &ldquo;Accounting Systems&rdquo;. In prior semesters this has caused confusion regarding the nature of this course. This course is more appropriately, and more traditionally, called &ldquo;Accounting Information Systems&rdquo; because the purpose is to explain the creation of accounting information. Perhaps, a better title would be &ldquo;Accounting <i>and</i> Information Systems&rdquo; to highlight that the course teaches the principles of an information system as they apply to accounting.</p>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h3>Not IT Specialists</h3>
			<p>The purpose of this course is not to encourage students to change their profession or to create accountants who can replace IT staff. Knowledge of accounting architecture creates accounting architects who can collaborate with IT staff to create and maintain information systems that will provide the best possible information for decision makers. The goal is to &ldquo;bridge the gap&rdquo; between business specialists and IT specialists.</p>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h3>Accounting Architecture - The Sections</h3>
			<div class="flex-row">
				<div class="flex-item override"><img src="../images/Arch5Color.png" alt="AA Arch" style="max-width: 300px"/></div>
				<div class="flex-item" style="max-width: 65%">
					<p>The arch of the accounting architecture has four sections: Foundation or Constraints, Information, Technology, and Control. The following slides introduce each of these sections, as well as the blocks that these sections comprise.</p>
				</div>
			</div>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h3>Constraints</h3>
			<p>Three forces determine the boundaries of a useful information system:
			<ul>
				<li><u><i>Compliance</i></u></li>
				<li><u><i>Business Model</i></u></li>
				<li><u><i>Technological Feasibility</i></u></li>
			</ul>
			<p>Think of these as the foundation of a house. The foundation is not sufficient to determine the <em>best</em> building schematics, but it can exclude many incompatible blueprints.</p>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h3>Compliance</h3>
			<p>The primary focus on accounting curriculum is accounting rules and regulations. Financial accounting, audit, and tax are rules-based, and any useful information system must generate information necessary to comply with these rules (e.g., financial statements, tax forms, etc.).</p>
			<p>Compliance also addresses contractual relationships with lenders, suppliers, and customers. Although these are not regulatory bodies, they may demand access to certain information or a certain level of security.</p>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h3>Business Model</h3>
			<p>Entrepreneurs and operations specialists generate business ideas and the model to execute those ideas. Accountants and information systems specialists report on the chosen model. As the information system collects data and reports on the existing business model, accountants can provide insights into potential modifications of the current model, as well as entirely new strategies. (Big Data analytics may be particularly useful for divining new strategies.)</p>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h3>Technological Feasibility</h3>
			<p>Some technological solutions cannot exist (under current circumstances): humanoid robots, flying cars, speed-of-light travel, large-scale quantum computing. Information systems are subject to these constraints of the physical world.</p>
			<p>Some solutions <em>can</em> but have not <em>yet</em> existed. Because companies are unique, informational needs are unique. The correct information system to collect or create all desired data may require in-house development. Companies must determine whether the value of the information exceeds the development cost.</p>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h3>Information</h3>
			<p>The Information section of the arch comprises three blocks:</p>
			<ol>
				<li><u><i>Creation</i></u>: data collection or acquisition and entry into the system.</li>
				<li><u><i>Use</i></u>: data analysis and reporting.</li>
				<li><u><i>Maintenance</i></u>: data storage and preservation.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>Each of these three blocks contains multiple steps. Together they form the information life cycle (i.e., what the information systems should do). Current employers have focused their attention on data analysis, but although Use is the culminating block of the Information section and the Architecture as a whole, knowledge of data analysis tools is incomplete without an understanding of the data and the process by which it becomes information.</p>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h3>Technology</h3>
			<p>The Technology section comprises four blocks:</p>
			<ol>
				<li><u><i>Hardware</i></u>: the physical components of the information system.</li>
				<li><u><i>Software</i></u>: operating systems and server- and client-side applications.</li>
				<li><u><i>Storage</i></u>: physical and logical data storage.</li>
				<li><u><i>Services</i></u>: networking and cloud computing.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>Whereas the Information section discusses the principles of information, the Technology blocks represent the physical manifestation of the information system (i.e., what the information system should be).</p>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h3>Controls</h3>
			<p>The Controls section also comprises four blocks:</p>
			<ol>
				<li><u><i>Security</i></u>: protecting unauthorized access.</li>
				<li><u><i>Availability</i></u>: preventing data loss and system downtime.</li>
				<li><u><i>Processing Integrity</i></u>: preventing data errors.</li>
				<li><u><i>Confidentiality</i></u>: safeguarding personal and corporate secrets.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>These four blocks are the AICPA Trust Services Framework. Although many other control frameworks exist, I have selected this because it focuses on data security (i.e., how the system is controlled). With the rise in cybersecurity threats, information security has become increasingly important, and accountants are particularly interested in compliance with good control practices.</p>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h3>Accounting Tie-Ins</h3>
			<p>Some students feel that these IT-related topics are not relevant to them and that they would prefer to focus on accounting regulations. I accept that it is my responsibility to prove otherwise. As a result, in each lecture I will try to include &ldquo;Accounting Tie-in&rdquo; slides in an attempt to emphasize how accounting architecture &ldquo;places the components of the information systems in context with accounting regulations,&rdquo; or in other words, how an accounting architecture principle matters to accountants.</p>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h3>The &ldquo;Big&rdquo; Tie-in</h3>
			<p>I developed the Accounting Architecture because employers want accountants with the ability to understand data and audit information systems.</p> 
			<ul>
				<li>Two Big 4 accounting firms have proposed additions to the current curriculum covering information system technologies.</li>
				<li>Partners from KPMG and PwC have expressed interest in hiring more accountants with IT knowledge.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Effective Fall 2015, Fogelman offers an additional MS in Accounting track for data analytics, as well as a certificate in Business Intelligence and Analysis. Even if only some students pursue this career path, this modification to the curriculum will improve these individuals' preparation and future opportunities.</p>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h3>What About &ldquo;Legacy Technologies&rdquo;?</h3>
			<p>PwC lists Microsoft Excel and Access as &ldquo;legacy technologies,&rdquo; and they continue to be valuable, especially Excel. However, these are &ldquo;business tools&rdquo; and not information technologies. As a result, they are not the best tools for data storage or analysis, although they are frequently used for these purposes. In this course, we will focus on enterprise-grade information systems, and we will not discuss these legacy business tools.</p>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h3>What About Quickbooks, etc?</h3>
			<p>Small and large businesses have different informational needs, different technological needs, and different abilities to hire IT staff to manage information systems. As a result, small firms may rely on small-business accounting applications, such as Quickbooks. Expertise with these tools may be useful in working as a bookkeeper in a small business, but the focus of this course is not on bookkeeping tools.</p>
