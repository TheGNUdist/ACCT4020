      <h1>Accounting Architecture</h1>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>What Is an Accountant?</h2>
      <p>Accounting textbooks teach us that accounting is the measurement and communication of economic activities. This makes accountants the custodians of business information. Most accounting courses teach regulations to prepare students to become staff accountants or auditors or tax preparers. Although these are valuable skills, the role of information custodianship is much broader than tax returns, journal entries, and ledgers. Information custodianship involves understanding how to create information from the data that financial and non-financial business transactions generate, and accounting employers have begun to realize the need for a broader perspective of the definition of an accountant.</p>

      <h2>Let Me Break It Down</h2>
      <p style="text-align: center"><span style="color: green">Accountants</span></p>
      <p style="text-align: center">measure and communicate</p>
      <p style="text-align: center">economic events</p>
      <p style="text-align: center">by <span style="font-style: italic; color: red">collecting</span> relevant <span style="font-weight: bold">data</span></p>
      <p style="text-align: center">into an <span style="font-weight: bold; color: darkgoldenrod">information system</span></p>
      <p style="text-align: center">and <span style="font-style: italic; color: red">converting</span> it</p>
      <p style="text-align: center">into useful <span style="font-weight: bold">information</span></p>
      <p style="text-align: center">for <span style="color: green">internal</span> and <span style="color: green">external stakeholders</span>.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Necessary Competencies</h2>
      <p>This accounting role has three main components:
      <ul>
        <li><u><em>Data collection</em></u>: the creation and acquisition of data.</li>
        <li><u><em>Data analytics</em></u>: the discovery of business information.</li>
        <li><u><em>Data visualization</em></u>: the reporting of business information to decision makers.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Accounting employers have also explicitly identified these core competencies as skills they look for in future hires. Because data collection brings data into an <em>information system</em> and because data analytics and visualization convert data in an <em>information system</em> into useful information, a clear understanding of the components and functions of an information system also becomes a necessary competency for all accountants.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Either Side of the Table</h2>
      <p>Proficiency in data collection, analytics, and visualization are vital regardless of the type work an accountant performs. Financial accountants and tax accountants file different reports, but they both use information systems to collect, analyze, and report. Managerial accountants focus on internal, as opposed to external, reports and stakeholders, but they need the same skills to perform the same tasks with the same information system. Even auditors, who are only interested in the accuracy of the reports and not in the information in the reports, use the client's information system to collect, analyze, and visualize client data. Incidentally, they also need an information system to report their findings.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Nothing New Under the Sun</h2>
      <p>The importance of understanding business data and the information system is not new to the accounting profession. For many decades, digital information systems have played a central role in supporting accountants in their data collection, analytics, and visualization tasks. More recently, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 mandated the evaluation and audit of client information systems by external auditors to verify that they meet control objectives to maintain data integrity and prevent unauthorized access. However, certain trends have caused employers have placed a renewed emphasis on acquiring data collection, analytics, and visualization skills and information systems expertise, making it even more important for accountants to focus on developing, retaining, and honing these skills.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Information Is Money</h2>
      <p>What has precipitated a renewed desire for these skills? <em>Big Data</em>. The world creates more than 2.5 quintillion bytes of data daily (1 quintillion bytes &asymp; 1 exabyte &asymp; 1 billion gigabytes) and the rate of data creation will continue to grow as more individuals use Internet-connected smart devices and as more individuals contribute in ever-increasing amounts of data on social media. The data growth rate is so extreme that despite the birth of the modern Internet being &ldquo;way back&rdquo; in the 1970s, more than 90% of all data is less than 5 years old. Understanding this data unlocks insights into customer behavior, economic trends, business strategies, etc.</p>

    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>The Information Era</h2>
      <p>The pursuit of information is the very reason for the proliferation of digital devices and information systems. Technological innovation is certainly cool, but technology is not an end to itself. All technology serves to access existing data or to generate new data. This phenomenon does not only apply to business. We as individuals experience it every day. We use Internet-connected devices as our personally portal into a plethora of information systems to read, watch, browse, search, buy, post, and follow. Each of these interactions accesses data or generates data, and most of them do both. Streaming a video allows creates data about what I like to watch. Reading a news article creates data about what topics interest me. That is how we all use information systems every day.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>All Types of Information?</h2>
      <p>Not all data that we create and access on a day-to-day basis immediately looks like accounting data, nor does it obviously relate to financial statements or tax forms. That does not mean that it is not accounting data or that accountants don't need to know about or care about it. Accounting education focuses primarily on accounting regulations, such as GAAP for financial accounting or GAAS for auditing, but accounting is much more than regulations. The largest consumer of accounting information is management, and management cares about any data and any information that can increase the firm's income and wealth. Accountants measure and communicate economic events to stakeholders, even if it comes from marketing data, HR data, finance data, or operations data. Accountants are custodians of all types of business data.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Why Can't Things Be the Way They Were Before?</h2>
      <p>Talk of collecting, analyzing, and visualizing all types of business data and understanding information systems may seem like a significant addition to the expectations placed on accountants, and, in fact, accountants as a group have not done a great job of filling these roles. For example, because accountants have a limited understanding of information systems, they have been poorly equipped to respond to past legislation requiring them to audit the reliability of existing information systems. The more technology- and data-driven the business world becomes, the more important these skills will be. Accountants need to keep up, or they risk being left behind.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Where It All Starts</h2>
      <p>Data collection, analytics, and visualization begin with a well-functioning accounting information system. Without the information system, there is no data, no information, no reporting. Because these functions begin with the information system, mastery of these competencies also begins with an understanding of the purposes, design, and functionality of information systems. Understanding the information system allows accountants to ensure that the correct data is collected, to verify that the data is stored properly and securely so that it will be available when it is needed, and to identify and use the technologies and tools that enable accountants to analyze the data and convert it into valuable information.</p>

      <h2>Accounting Architecture</h2>
      <div class="flex-row">
        <div class="flex-item override"><img src="../images/arch.png" alt="Accounting Architecture Model" style="max-width: 300px"/></div>
        <div class="flex-item" style="max-width: 70%">
      <p>Understanding information systems begins with a framework that summarizes and explains the objectives, inputs, outputs, and makeup of an information system. <em><u>Accounting architecture</u></em> is a unifying framework of accounting information and the system that supplies that information. An understanding of accounting architecture prepares accountants to become information custodians. The arch displayed here provides a graphical representation of the components of accounting architecture. The arch comprises four sections: <strong>Environment</strong>, <strong>Information</strong>, <strong>Technology</strong>, and <strong>Control</strong>.</p>
        </div>
      </div>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Why Architecture?</h2>
      <p>Many disciplines have concepts of the structure, building blocks, and form of a system, and they call these &ldquo;architecture&rdquo; in the same sense that a physical structure has an architecture. Business architecture is the design of business models and activities to fulfill business strategies. Software architecture is the structure and design of computer software. IT/systems architecture is the design of computer systems. Accounting architecture relies heavily on systems architecture, and as such, could be called accounting systems architecture. However, this is too limiting a label. Accounting architecture is the structure of accounting information, as well as the structure of the information system necessary to capture, record, and communicate that information.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Environment</h2>
      <p>The environment is the collection of external and internal forces that affect the business entity and its accounting information. These environmental constructs determine the boundaries of a useful information system:
      <ul style="display: inline-block">
        <li><u><em>Compliance</em></u></li>
        <li><u><em>Business Model</em></u></li>
        <li><u><em>Risk</em></u></li>
      </ul>
      <p>Think of these as the foundation of a house. The foundation is not sufficient to determine the <em>best</em> building schematics, but it can exclude many incompatible blueprints.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Compliance</h2>
      <p>In the first place, <u><em>compliance</em></u> deals with the entity's regulatory environment. The main focus of accounting courses is accounting rules and regulations. Financial accounting, audit, and tax are rules-based, and any useful information system must generate information necessary to comply with these rules (e.g., financial statements, tax forms, etc.). Federal, state, and local laws are also part of the regulatory environment.</p>
      <p>Compliance also addresses contractual relationships with lenders, suppliers, and customers. Although these are not regulatory bodies, they may demand access to certain information or a certain level of security.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Business Model</h2>
      <p>The <u><em>business model</em></u> is the form the business entity takes to achieve its business strategies. This can include the chosen industry to operate in, ownership structure, financing method, investments, etc. The form of the business model is under the purview of business architects. Accountants and information systems specialists report on the chosen business model. As the information system collects data and reports on the existing business model, accountants can provide insights into potential modifications of the current model, as well as entirely new strategies. (Big Data analytics has been particularly useful for divining new business strategies.)</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Risk</h2>
      <p>Any business environment contains both <u><em>internal and external risks</em></u>. External risks include general economic conditions, industry competition and developments, availability of financing and financing requirements, litigation, technological developments, and digital threats (e.g., hacking). Internal risks include business expansion, management ability and core competencies, corporate governance and culture, changes in key personnel, resource capacity, fraud, data loss and error, and technological feasibility of business and IT objectives. These risks influence the types of data that the information system should gather and process and, more importantly, also the set of controls the business entity should implement to prevent these risks from threatening profitability.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Information</h2>
      <p>The Information section of the arch comprises three blocks:</p>
      <ol>
        <li><u><em>Creation</em></u>: data collection or acquisition and entry into the system.</li>
        <li><u><em>Use</em></u>: data analysis and reporting.</li>
        <li><u><em>Maintenance</em></u>: data storage and preservation.</li>
      </ol>
      <p>Each of these three blocks contains multiple steps. Together they form the information life cycle (i.e., what the information systems should do). Current employers have focused their attention on data analysis, but although Use is the culminating block of the Information section and the architecture model as a whole, knowledge of data analysis tools is incomplete without an understanding of the data and the process by which it becomes information.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Technology</h2>
      <p>The Technology section comprises four blocks:</p>
      <ol>
        <li><u><em>Hardware</em></u>: the physical components of the information system.</li>
        <li><u><em>Software</em></u>: operating systems and server- and client-side applications.</li>
        <li><u><em>Storage</em></u>: physical and logical data storage.</li>
        <li><u><em>Services</em></u>: networking and cloud computing.</li>
      </ol>
      <p>Whereas the Information section discusses the principles of information, the Technology blocks represent the physical manifestation of the information system (i.e., what the information system should be).</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Solutions &ne; Tools</h2>
      <p>It is popular to ask, &ldquo;How can I achieve solution X with tool Y?&rdquo; (e.g., How can I track sales [X] in Microsoft Access [Y]?) This attitude leads to an overly restrictive view of possible solutions to business problems, especially in situations when individuals have familiarity with only a small set of tools (e.g., Y always equals Microsoft Excel). This phenomenon is known as the Law of the Instrument: If all you have is a hammer, every problem looks like a nail. Rephrasing this question and decomposing it into multiple parts&mdash;&ldquo;How can I achieve solution X?&rdquo; and &ldquo;Which tool(s) can best help me to achieve solution X?&rdquo;&mdash;redirects attention away from tools and toward solutions. Because the solution is the actual goal, focusing on solutions instead of tools can result in superior business outcomes.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>What About Tools?</h2>
      <p>Even when focusing on solutions, an information system must, in the end, comprise specific technological tools. As a result, a grasp of accounting architecture is incomplete without an understanding of some enterprise-grade information system technologies. Although Microsoft Excel and Access, Quickbooks, and the like are popular business tools, they have (severely) limited application toward accounting architecture. Important architecture tools, such as operating systems, data entry and storage solutions, analysis and reporting software, and networking, have much broader applicability and adaptability.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Controls</h2>
      <p>The Controls section also comprises four blocks:</p>
      <ol>
        <li><u><em>Security</em></u>: protecting against unauthorized access.</li>
        <li><u><em>Confidentiality</em></u>: safeguarding personal and corporate secrets.</li>
        <li><u><em>Availability</em></u>: preventing data loss and system downtime.</li>
        <li><u><em>Processing Integrity</em></u>: preventing data errors.</li>
      </ol>
      <p>These four blocks are the AICPA Trust Services Criteria. Although many other control frameworks exist, I have selected this because it focuses on data security (i.e., how the system is controlled). With the rise in cybersecurity threats, information security has become increasingly important, and accountants are particularly interested in compliance with good control practices.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>This Is Your Business</h2>
      <p>Employers want accountants with the ability to understand data and audit information systems.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Two Big 4 accounting firms have proposed additions to the current curriculum covering information system technologies.</li>
        <li>Partners from KPMG and PwC have expressed interest in hiring more accountants with IT knowledge.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Understanding accounting architecture prepares accountants to move into the future of the accounting profession. It also prepares accounting students for the new data-driven focus of the business world.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Not IT Specialists</h2>
      <p>The goal of this framework is not to encourage accountants to change their profession or to create accountants who can replace IT staff. Knowledge of accounting architecture creates accountants, or rather accounting architects, who can collaborate with IT staff to create and maintain information systems that will provide the best possible information for decision makers. The goal is to &ldquo;bridge the gap&rdquo; between business specialists and IT specialists. Some have called this practice &ldquo;business-led IT&rdquo; because business specialists lead systems design. However, &ldquo;accounting-led IT&rdquo; may be more appropriate to emphasize the importance of accountants with their unique business knowledge collaborating with IT staff.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Quotes on Collaboration</h2>
      <blockquote>IT staff must become more business aware and understand how their decisions impact the bottom-line.<br> &ndash; Robert Reeves, CTO, Datical</blockquote>
      <blockquote>IT needs to find individuals who can work effectively with line-of-business teams and transform them to drive value to the enterprise.<br> &ndash; Chris Bedi, CIO, ServiceNow</blockquote>
      <blockquote>[It] is a tough job that balances skills across business, technology, and leadership.<br> &ndash; Mike Macrie, CIO, Land O' Lakes</blockquote>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>DevOps</h2>
      <p>Collaboration between IT and business specialists is vital because companies increasingly develop their information systems in house and need business expertise to know what data to collect. This collaborative effort is often called &ldquo;<em><u>DevOps</u></em>,&rdquo; which term combines the words <em><u>development</u></em> and <em><u>operations</u></em>. DevOps has some highly technical implications for systems development, but on a high level, it serves as a reminder that cross-functional teams are the best solution for developing systems to meet stakeholders' informational needs. DevOps also highlights a number of important principles of effective engineers that also apply to effective accounting architects: <em><u>Communication matters</u></em>, <em><u>Forget, &ldquo;I don't know&rdquo;</u></em>, <em><u>RTFM</u></em>, and <em><u>Search before asking</u></em>.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Communication Matters</h2>
      <p>Collaboration is about communication. Many accountants, even accounting architects, will not use technical skills on a regular basis. The role of accountants is to collaborate with IT staff on the design, maintenance, and audit of information systems using <em>words</em>. The ability to communicate and collaborate requires familiarity with IT tools, practices, and controls, but it also requires the ability to write and speak clearly with proper spelling and grammar.</p>

      <h2><a href="https://opensource.com/open-organization/17/5/5-devops-laws" target="_blank" rel="noopener" aria-label="Website opens in new window">Forget, &ldquo;I Don't Know&rdquo;</a></h2>
      <p>&ldquo;I don't know&rdquo; is the verbal equivalent of throwing your hands up in defeat. Treat every task as an opportunity to learn. Prove to your peers that you can enable the team to go further. Seek out new knowledge and improve upon the things you build and maintain. Do not be afraid to dive headlong into something you know nothing about. Your thirst for knowledge should be unquenchable. You might not know it today, but you can know it tomorrow.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2><a href="https://opensource.com/open-organization/17/5/5-devops-laws" target="_blank" rel="noopener" aria-label="Website opens in new window">RTFM and Search Before Asking</a></h2>
      <p>The first, second, and fourth letters in RTFM stand for, &ldquo;<em><u>Read The Manual</u></em>&rdquo;. Documentation is everywhere. Make an effort to not ask your peers how something works without reading its documentation first. Time is life's most precious resource. Don't waste theirs.</p>
      <blockquote>He said, &ldquo;Welcome to the freakin' Guardians of the Galaxy,&rdquo; only he didn't say &ldquo;freakin'.&rdquo;<br> &ndash; Rocket</blockquote>
      <p>The solutions to your problem will not fall out of the sky. Solving new problems requires searching for new answers. We live in an amazing time; solutions to complex problems are at our fingertips. Go and look for them.</p>

    <section>
      <h2>Final Word</h2>
      <blockquote>We're always looking for people who can have both a deep technology conversation, as well as a deep business conversation. You need the right blend of those people in your organization. But we also can't forget that technology is hard, and people who are very skilled at technology don't always have an interest in business processes. Having that right mix&mdash;and respecting them both appropriately&mdash;is a responsibility of the CIO and his team.<br> &ndash; Keith Collins, CIO, SAS</blockquote>
