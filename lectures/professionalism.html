      <h2>Before Knowledge</h2>
      <p>Before we begin our discussions of information, technology, and control, I wish to impress upon your minds the attitudes necessary to successfully transition from student to professional. In this course, I can impart knowledge (if, and only if, you are willing to receive it), but the metamorphosis from student to professional involves more than the acquisition of core competencies. Professionalism is a commitment to a way of life.</p>
      <p>That commitment brings numerous benefits. In the first place, professionalism sets you apart from your peers. Standing out in a good way earns you jobs, added responsibility, promotions, and opportunities. In the second place, professionalism keeps you honest and out of jail. That is no exaggeration.</p>

          <p>Professionalism prevents fraud. The Fraud Triangle highlights the three necessary conditions for fraud to occur: pressure (e.g., financial or peer), opportunity, and rationalization (i.e., the belief that the fraud was justified). Later in the course, we will discuss control as a means to reduce opportunity, but only internal commitment can prevent rationalization. Professionalism is the embodiment of that commitment.</p>

      <h2>Professionalism Prevents More Than Fraud</h2>
      <p>These frauds certainly represent the exception, not the norm. However, professionalism remains important for two reasons. First, the best way, and perhaps the only way, to avoid the consequences of these fraudsters is to make different choices. Don't assume you will make the right choices; commit to making the right choices.</p>
      <p>Second, professionalism prevents more than theft and accounting fraud. These are a few examples:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Inappropriate language</li>
        <li>Improper dress</li>
        <li>Discrimination</li>
        <li>Harassment</li>
        <li>Shirking</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>What is Professionalism?</h2>
      <p>Professionalism prevents fraud and all kinds of behaviors that get people fired. That is reason enough to make learning what professionalism is valuable. However, professionalism additionally instills positive traits that create valuable personal and professional opportunities in life. Based on these benefits, everyone should want to understand professionalism and commit to it.<p>
      <p>What is professionalism? A professional certainly exhibits many different positive character traits, but the American Institute for Certified Public Accountants (AICPA) provides some guidance with the following list of professional characteristics in its Code of Professional Conduct: <u><em>Competence</em></u>, <u><em>Diligence</em></u>, <u><em>Integrity</em></u>, <u><em>Objectivity</em></u>, and <u><em>Responsibility</em></u>.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Competence</h2>
      <p>Competence is knowledge, and all professionals must possess a common body of knowledge. Accountants must know accounting; engineers must know engineering; programmers must know programming. In many professions, especially accounting, competence is demonstrated by certification. University programs provide certification in the form of undergraduate and graduate degrees. These programs also offer a curriculum of core competencies as the foundation of professional competence, but it is the sole responsibility of students to acquire competence. Any student waiting around to be spoon-fed knowledge is not on track to becoming a professional. Learning is not the passive receipt of competence; it is the active pursuit of competence.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Beyond Core Competencies</h2>
      <p>Core competencies provide only a foundation of knowledge. Unfortunately, accounting programs have been slow to respond to changing needs in the accounting profession. As a result, accounting students and professionals must become increasingly proactive in acquiring knowledge above and beyond core competencies in order to adapt to the changing business environment. The pursuit of additional knowledge involves (1) taking classes outside of one's own discipline in order to gain a greater breadth of knowledge and (2) engaging in life-long learning in order to adapt perpetually to changes in the economy, information technology, and the accounting profession. Remember, university education is not the only way to obtain competence (e.g., programmers are usually evaluated on their skills, not their degrees).</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Diligence</h2>
      <p>In the opening scene of the Oscar-winning film <i>Patton</i>, George C. Scott gives a speech to soldiers facing deployment to the front lines of WWII. He perfectly captures the principle of diligence in a single sentence:</p>
      <blockquote class="print-centered">I don't want to get any messages saying that we are holding our position. We are not holding anything. We are advancing constantly!</blockquote>
      <p>Diligence means committing to always do your best, but diligence also demands continuous improvement. Professionals <u><em>advance constantly</em></u> by being life-long learners and by improving their skills and performance each day.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Not the Bear</h2>
      <p>Some rationalize a lack of diligence and continuous improvement by claiming that success in life involves not being eaten by a bear.</p>
      <blockquote class="print-centered">When being chased by a bear, it is not necessary to outrun the bear, just the person next to you.</blockquote>
      <p>This attitude is not at all professional for several reasons. First, professionals are not satisfied with justifying their own bad behavior by comparing it to the worse choices of others. In fact, judging others is generally not a professional thing to do. Second, two wrongs will not make a right, and a worse wrong will not make a lesser wrong a right.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>The Lion and the Gazelle</h2>
      <p>The life of a professional is not about avoiding last place. However, the analogy of the bear is correct in one aspect. Life will involve running.</p>
      <blockquote class="print-centered">Every morning in Africa, a gazelle wakes up, it knows it must outrun the fastest lion or it will be killed. Every morning in Africa, a lion wakes up. It knows it must run faster than the slowest gazelle, or it will starve. It doesn't matter whether you're a lion or a gazelle. When the sun comes up, you'd better be running.</blockquote>
      <p>Always being ready to start the day running leads a professional to the best opportunities life has to offer.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Diligence vs. Prioritization</h2>
      <p>Diligence alone is not enough. Time is the most valuable of all resources&mdash;everyone receives 24 hours each day for free, but even the wealthiest cannot acquire more of it. Diligently pursuing useless tasks will not result in wise use of that precious resource. For example, shortly after the video game <i>Guitar Hero</i> was released, one gamer expressed the intention to master every level at the most difficult setting. A wise individual responded that channelling that effort into learning to play an actual guitar might be a wiser choice. Prioritization allows us to identify goals that are worth our time, and true diligence (i.e., advancing constantly) is the pursuit of the highest priority goals. Diligently pursuing a distraction is not a substitute.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Integrity &amp; Objectivity</h2>
      <p>Integrity and objectivity are both aspects of honesty. Structural integrity determines whether a building will remain standing. A lack of integrity causes buildings, and lives, to fall by succumbing to external forces, such as pressure to commit fraud. Integrity in word and deed means to tell the truth&mdash;the whole truth and nothing but the truth&mdash;and to keep commitments. Perhaps the most important aspect of a professional's reputation is a willingness to keep commitments. Competency can be taught, diligence can be coached, but integrity must come from within.</p>
      <p>Similarly, objectivity means to remain unbiased. Bias can come from one's own opinion or from the opinions of others. Objectivity is accepting the truth no matter whose opinion it opposes.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Three Sides of the Fraud Triangle</h2>
      <div class="flex-row">
        <div class="flex-item" style="max-width: 55%">
          <p>Integrity would have saved Nick Leeson. He would never have brought down an entire bank if he had told the truth after the first bad trade. Interestingly, integrity would have combatted all three necessary conditions for fraud to occur. The pressure to commit fraud came from the desire to cover a lie; the opportunity to commit fraud came from the decision to hide his lie in an error account; and any rationalization of fraud is inherently a lie.</p>
        </div>

        </div>
      </div>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Responsibility</h2>
      <p>A commitment to any aspect of professionalism requires responsibility. Responsibility is ownership. Responsibility for competence is ownership of the learning process. Responsibility for integrity and objectivity is ownership of the truth. Responsibility for diligence is ownership of the commitment to advance constantly. Professionals take responsibility for embodying all of these traits. Professionals also take responsibility for their profession. Competence, diligence, integrity, and objectivity preserve a professional's own reputation, but they also preserve the reputation of the profession. The Enron and WorldCom scandals caused the public to lose faith in the accounting profession. Because that was a consequence of only a few individuals, professionals must, above all, accept responsibility for the consequences of their own choices.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Choices Have Consequences</h2>
      <p>One of the most important lessons from any public fraud or scandal is that choices have consequences. The belief that everyone is free to make choices is very popular, and unfortunately, this belief has spawned the expectation that choices should have no consequences, or rather that consequences are an infringement on the individual's right to choose. However, those who have served in the military know that &ldquo;freedom is not free,&rdquo; and the freedom to choose is not without cost. That cost comes in the form of consequences. Each time someone makes a choice, that person has also chosen the consequences. A professional accepts those consequences.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>You're the One that I Want</h2>
      <p>One of the reasons why people often struggle to accept consequences is that they fail to understand the principle of preferences: we do what we truly want. If we wanted something else, we would have chosen something else. Oftentimes when consequences come, people conclude that they <em>wanted</em> a different outcome, but because they chose the actions that facilitated  consequences, they, in fact, <em>wanted</em> those consequences. One popular course of action to avoid consequences is to change behavior as the consequences come as evidence that the consequences are undeserved, but consequences are the result of past choices. Current choices will only affect consequences in the future, not the present.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>No One Is an Island</h2>
      <p>Professionals work and live in communities, and they have responsibility for the members of those communities. Charles Dickens's popular novel <i>A Christmas Carol</i> tells the story of Ebenezer Scrooge who learns that he is personally responsible for the welfare of others. As Marley's ghost observes:</p>
      <blockquote class="print-centered">Business?! Mankind was my business! The common welfare was my business; charity, mercy, forbearance and benevolence were all my business. The dealings of my trade were but a drop of water in the comprehensive ocean of my business!</blockquote>
      <p>The same message applies to all professionals, especially accountants whose primary role is to act on behalf of others.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Dress the Part and Talk the Talk</h2>
      <p>Dress is one key outward manifestation of professionalism. For men, professional dress is a suit, a long-sleeved, button-down shirt, and tie. For women, professional dress is a pants or skirt suit, button-down blouse, and closed-toed shoes. These are the uniform of a professional.</p>
      <p>Another key outward manifestation of professionalism is communication. Verbal and written communication are a prominent part of any professional's life. Just as the AICPA lists rules for professional conduct, professional communication also follows specific rules. Following the rules of professional communication, especially for emails, is vital for the success of any professional.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Sample Professional Letter</h2>
      <p>This is the professional letter that the CEO of Comcast wrote to the board of 21st Century Fox on June 13, 2018, with a merger offer:</p>
      <iframe class="screen-iframe" src="https://drive.google.com/viewerng/viewer?embedded=true&url=https://accountingarchitecture.github.io/images/comcast.pdf" width="1100" height="375"></iframe>

      <p>(NB: The CEO of Comcast likely knows the Murdoch family personally and can address them by their first names.)
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Email the Email - Salutation</h2>
      <p>Use a proper salutation. Do not use &ldquo;Hello,&rdquo; &ldquo;Hey,&rdquo; &ldquo;Hi,&rdquo; &ldquo;Good morning,&rdquo; &ldquo;Good afternoon,&rdquo; &ldquo;Good evening,&rdquo; or other informal salutations. Addressing the recipient by name (if known) is preferred. Type the recipient's title (&ldquo;Dr.&rdquo;, &ldquo;Mr.&rdquo;, &ldquo;Mrs.&rdquo;, &ldquo;Ms.&rdquo; etc.) and the recipient's last name, followed by a comma, colon, or hyphen. You should never use the recipient's first name unless you have express permission to do so. If you are uncertain which title to use, it is safe to use the title in the recipient's signature block if the recipient has previously emailed you. For professors, use the titles &ldquo;Dr.&rdquo; or &ldquo;Professor&rdquo; followed by the recipient's last name. If you do not know the name of the person you are writing to, use the salutation &ldquo;Dear Sir or Madam:&rdquo; or &ldquo;To whom it may concern:&rdquo;.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Email the Email - Body</h2>
      <p>Introduce yourself in the first paragraph. Explain who you are and why you are writing. When writing to a professor, also explain which class and section you are in. This introduction should be in the first sentence or two of your email. Throughout the body, use formal language. Use complete sentences and polite phrasing. Never write emails as you would write text messages. Avoid slang, contractions, emoticons and emojis, profanity, jokes, accusations, and rude or offensive language.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Email the Email - Closing</h2>
      <p>Use a proper form of closing. Examples of potential closings include: &ldquo;Sincerely,&rdquo; &ldquo;Respectfully,&rdquo; or &ldquo;Your student,&rdquo; (if emailing a professor) followed by your full name and job title or other signature (if you have one).</p>
      <p>After completing an email with proper salutation, body, and closing, proofread your message for content, spelling, and grammar. Do not rely on your email service's spelling or grammar checker. Reading your email aloud or asking someone to proofread it is a great way to catch any typos, mistakes, or unclear phrases. Eliminating spelling and grammar errors is as important for writing a professional email as is using proper salutation, body, and closing.</p>

      <h2>Cover Emails</h2>
      <p>Professionalism is especially important when applying for jobs. Cover emails for job applications follow the same guidelines as other professional letters for salutation and closing. In many cases, the applicant may not know who the recipient of the cover letter will be, so salutations, such as &ldquo;Dear Sir or Madam:&rdquo; or &ldquo;To whom it may concern&rdquo; may be necessary.</p>
      <p>The body of a cover email should be brief, usually no more than three paragraphs. As with any professional email, the first paragraph should introduce the applicant and explain the purpose of the email. The purpose should list the specific position being applied for and where the position is posted. The first paragraph should also include a sentence explaining why the applicant is a good candidate for the position.</p>

      <h2>Focus on Strengths</h2>
      <p>The second paragraph in a cover email provides additional evidence and support for the assertion in the first paragraph. Here again, less is more. The recruiter will already expect that the applicant meets educational and experience requirements, so these will not set the applicant apart. The recruiter wants to see what makes this applicant different. Highlighting unique work experience and unique educational experience and explaining how they set the applicant apart give the recruiter a reason to give the application serious consideration.</p>
      <p>The final paragraph should thank the recruiter for considering the application and express an interest in interviewing. It should also include the applicant's contact information.</p>
