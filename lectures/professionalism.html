			<h1>Professionalism</h1>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h2>Before Knowledge</h2>
			<p>Before we begin our discussions of information, technology, and control, I wish to impress upon your minds the attitudes necessary to successfully transition from student to professional. In this course, I can impart knowledge (if, and only if, you are willing to receive it), but the metamorphosis from student to professional involves more than the acquisition of core competencies. Professionalism is a commitment to a way of life.</p>

			<h2>Reasons for Fraud</h2>

				<div class="flex-item" style="max-width: 60%">
					<p>The Fraud Triangle highlights the three necessary conditions for fraud to occur: pressure (e.g., financial or peer), opportunity, and rationalization (i.e., the belief that the fraud was justified). Later in the course, we will discuss control as a means to reduce opportunity, but only internal commitment can prevent rationalization. Professionalism is the embodiment of that commitment.</p>

			<h2>The List Goes On</h2>
			<p>Additional frauds include:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Adelphia: Understated liabilities</li>
				<li>AIG: Overstated reserves</li>
				<li>AIG, <em>again</em>: Funneled money away from investors to private companies to increase executive compensation</li>
				<li>AIG, <em>again, again</em>: Earmarked bailout funds for executive bonuses</li>
			</ul>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h2>Fraud Is Not the Only Issue</h2>
			<p>In truth, most will never commit a widely publicized fraud, or even a secret fraud, for that matter. Fortunately, professionalism protects against more than just theft. These are a few examples:</p>
			<ul style="display: inline-block">
				<li>Inappropriate language</li>
				<li>Improper dress</li>
				<li>Discrimination</li>
				<li>Harassment</li>
				<li>Shirking</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Certainly, this is not a comprehensive list, nor is it in any particular order of importance.</p>

			<h2>Why Professionalism Matters to You</h2>
			<blockquote>In an era where competition is accelerating, jobs are scarce, and the world is meaner, professionalism and work ethic can differentiate strong from average performers. Whether or not we like it, professional behaviour matters.<br>&ndash; Dr. Colleen Sharen</blockquote>
			<p style="text-align: center">Soon, your focus will be on interviews, internships, and jobs. Professionalism sets you apart.</p>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h2>Why <em>Else</em> Professionalism Matters to You</h2>
			<blockquote>The boundary is powerful because you don't cross it; if you have justified doing it once, there's nothing to stop you doing it again.<br>&ndash; Dr. Clayton Christensen</blockquote>
			<p style="text-align: center">Professionalism keeps you out of jail.</p>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h2>What is Professionalism?</h2>
			<p>The American Institute for Certified Public Accountants (AICPA) highlights the following characteristics in its Code of Professional Conduct, which we can use as the model for a professional accountant:</p>
			<ul style="display: inline-block">
				<li>Diligence</li>
				<li>Competence</li>
				<li>Responsibility</li>
				<li>Integrity</li>
				<li>Objectivity</li>
			</ul>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h2>Diligence</h2>
			<p>In the opening scene of the Oscar-winning film <i>Patton</i>, George C. Scott gives a speech to soldiers facing deployment to the front lines of WWII. In it, one sentence perfectly captures the concept of diligence:</p>
			<blockquote>I don't want to get any messages saying that we are holding our position. We are not holding anything. We are advancing constantly!</blockquote>
			<p>Diligence is not satisfied with one's best. Diligence seeks continuous improvement. Professionals <em>advance constantly</em> by learning more and improving each day.</p>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h2>Not the Bear</h2>
			<p>Some rationalize a lack of diligence and continuous improvement by claiming that success in life involves not being eaten by a bear.</p>
			<blockquote>When being chased by a bear, it is not necessary to outrun the bear, just the person next to you.</blockquote>
			<p>First, professionals are not satisfied with justifying their own behavior by comparing it to the worse choices of others. Two wrongs will not make a right, and a worse wrong will not make a lesser wrong a right.</p>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h2>The Lion and the Gazelle</h2>
			<p>Second, the life of a professional is not about avoiding last place. However, the analogy of the bear is correct in one aspect. Life will involve running.</p>
			<blockquote>Every morning in Africa, a gazelle wakes up, it knows it must outrun the fastest lion or it will be killed. Every morning in Africa, a lion wakes up. It knows it must run faster than the slowest gazelle, or it will starve. It doesn't matter whether you're the lion or a gazelle when the sun comes up, you'd better be running.</blockquote>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h2>Diligence vs. Prioritization</h2>
			<p>Diligence alone is not enough. Time is the most valuable of all resources&mdash;even the wealthiest cannot acquire more of it. Diligently pursuing useless tasks will not result in wise use of that precious resource. For example, shortly after the video game <i>Guitar Hero</i> was released, one gamer expressed the intention to master every level of the most difficult setting. Recognizing the necessary diligence to achieve this goal, one individual responded that channelling that effort into learning to play an actual guitar might be a wiser choice. Prioritization allows us to identify goals that are worth our time, and true diligence (i.e., advancing constantly) is the pursuit of the highest priority goals. Diligently pursuing a distraction is not a substitute.</p>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h2>Competence</h2>
			<p>Competence is knowledge, and each professional must possess a common body of knowledge. The acquisition of this body of knowledge requires diligence, reasoning, and accreditation. The School of Accountancy provides the accreditation. At some point in history, the erroneous belief was perpetuated that teachers were responsible for the rest (i.e., to give students knowledge). Any student who truly wishes to become a professional must discard this popular belief. Teachers provide materials, context, and clarification, but students are solely responsible for learning. Learning is not the passive receipt of competence, rather it is the active pursuit thereof.</p>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h2>Core Competencies: A Note</h2>
			<p>Core competencies are the foundation of profession-specific competence. Unfortunately, the accounting profession has been slow to update a list of core competencies for accounting professionals. Other accounting courses cover the more traditional accounting competencies, whereas this course addresses new competencies that the profession has only begun to recognize. Accountants who acquire this additional knowledge set themselves apart from their peers.</p>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h2>Beyond the Core</h2>
			<p>Regardless of how accurately university curriculum depicts the true core competencies of an accounting professional, competence goes far beyond this list of competencies. Competence is the ability to speak and write correctly and intelligently; competence is up-to-date knowledge of the profession; competence is logical thinking; competence is a lifetime pursuit.</p>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h2>Responsibility</h2>
			<p>Responsibility is ownership. For example, responsibility for competence is the ownership of the learning process. A professional accepts responsibility for assigned tasks, the company's corporate mission, the perpetuation of the profession, and, most importantly, for choices and consequences.</p>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h2>Choices Have Consequences</h2>
			<p>One of the most important lessons from any public fraud or scandal is that choices have consequences. The belief that everyone is free to make choices is very popular, and unfortunately, this belief has spawned the expectation that choices should have no consequences, or rather that consequences are an infringement on the individual's right to choose. However, the freedom to choose is not without cost, and that cost comes in the form of consequences. Each time someone makes a choice, that person has also chosen the consequences. A professional accepts those consequences.</p>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h2>You're the One that I Want</h2>
			<p>One of the reasons why people often struggle to accept consequences is that they fail to understand the principle of preferences: everyone does what they truly want. If they wanted something else, they would have chosen something else. Oftentimes when consequences come, people conclude that they <em>wanted</em> a different outcome, but because they chose the actions that facilitated those consequences, they, in fact, <em>wanted</em> those consequences. One popular course of action to avoid consequences is to change behavior as the consequences come as evidence that the consequences are undeserved, but consequences are the result of past choices, and current choices will only affect consequences in the future, not the present.</p>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h2>No One Is an Island</h2>
			<p>Professionals work and live in communities, and they have responsibility for the members of those communities. Charles Dickens's popular novel <i>A Christmas Carol</i> tells the story of Ebenezer Scrooge who learns that he is personally responsible for the welfare of others. As Marley's ghost observes:</p>
			<blockquote>Business! Mankind was my business! The common welfare was my business; charity, mercy, forbearance and benevolence were all my business. The dealings of my trade were but a drop of water in the comprehensive ocean of my business!</blockquote>
			<p>The same message applies to all professionals, especially accountants whose primary role is to act on behalf of others.</p>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h2>Integrity and Objectivity</h2>
			<p>It is possible to address the last two traits from the AICPA Code of Professional Conduct together because both are manifestations of an adherence to honesty. On the one hand, integrity in word and deed means to tell the truth&mdash;the whole truth and nothing but the truth&mdash;and to keep commitments. On the other hand, objectivity means to accept the truth even when it disagrees with one's own opinions.</p>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h2>Three Sides of the Triangle</h2>
			<div class="flex-row">
				<div class="flex-item" style="max-width: 60%">
					<p>Nick Leeson would never have been able to accumulate sufficient losses to bring down an entire bank if he had told the truth after the first bad trade. Interestingly, in this case professionalism would have reduced pressure, opportunity, and rationalization.</p>

				</div>
			</div>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h2>Talk the Talk</h2>
			<p>Much of professionalism is internal conviction, but it has externally visible fruits. One of those is how a professional addresses others. In general, this involves politeness and respect, but it begins with the use of proper titles. The current culture has promoted casual speech using first names, but this is neither wise nor professional. The professional standard is to use the highest title. At a minimum, this is Mr. or Ms., but if the individual has a higher academic, governmental, or military title, these are superior. This applies to verbal conversations, as well as emails. (Hint: I fall into this category, and any communication with me should begin with my proper title: Professor.)</p>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h2>Walk the Walk</h2>
			<p>Another outward manifestation of professionalism is dress. Here again, the current culture has discouraged professional behavior, but that is no excuse for a true professional. For men, professional dress is a suit, a long-sleeved, button-down shirt, and tie, and for women, a pants or skirt suit, button-down blouse, and closed-toed shoes. (Hint: This level of professional dress also applies to recruiting events and class presentations.)</p>
