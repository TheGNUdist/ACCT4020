			<h2>Accounting Architecture</h2>
			<div class="flex-row">
				<div class="flex-item override"><img src="../images/arch.png" alt="Accounting Architecture Model" style="max-width: 300px"/></div>
				<div class="flex-item" style="max-width: 65%">
					<p>The Storage block of accounting architecture builds on both the Hardware and Software blocks because digital storage comprises a combination of hardware and software components. The storage drives represent the storage hardware, and file and database systems represent the storage software. Together, storage hardware and software serve to operationalize the Storage step in the information life cycle.</p>
				</div>
			</div>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h2>Types of Storage Systems</h2>
			<ul>
				<li><u><em>File systems</em></u> store data in separate files and folders.</li>
				<li><u><em>Database systems</em></u> store all data in a single location.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>These two storage systems predate digital storage. A paper documents and folders in a filing cabinet is a physical file system, and a card catalog in a library is an example of a physical database system. The same principles apply to digital storage, and although the software portion of digital storage is the most visible from the users' perspective, the storage system begins with hardware. Digital storage hardware is analagous to the filing cabinet in a physical file system.</p>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h2>Physical Volumes</h2>
			<div class="flex-row">
				<div class="flex-item" style="max-width: 80%">
				<p>Digital storage begins with the storage drive. The storage drives provide the <u><em>physical volumes</em></u>. A physical volume is a <u><em>partition</em></u>, and it cover all or part of the capacity of a storage drive. Once created, the size of a partition is static. This makes file or database systems stored on physical volumes more difficult to manage because storage needs can change over time. Each storage drive with at least one partition first needs a <u><em>partition table</em></u>, which is a small amount of software stored on the drive to identify how many partitions the drive has, what type they are, and how large they are.</p>
				</div>
				<div class="flex-item override"><img src="../images/partition.png" alt="Storage Drive with 3 Partitions"/></div>
			</div>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h2>Volume Groups</h2>
			<p>Logical volumes help to overcome the rigidity of physical volumes. Logical volumes begin by combining one or more physical volumes into a volume group. Physical volumes in a volume group can be can come from one or more storage drives. This creates considerable flexibility in forming volume groups. They can comprise a part of one storage drive, a whole storage drive, parts of multiple storage drives, all of multiple storage drives, or all of some storage drives and some others. Volume groups are also resizable. Additional physical volumes, either additional partitions of a drive that already belongs to the volume group or an additional drive altogether, can be added to an existing volume group to increase available storage capacity.</p>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h2>Logical Volumes</h2>
			<p>Logical volumes function like physical volumes, except that physical volumes are formed from the storage capacity of storage drives, whereas logical volumes are formed from the storage capacity of the volume group. When creating logical volumes, the volume group makes no disctinction between the various physical volumes that make up the group. A single logical volume may be contained within a single physical volume, or it may straddle multiple physical volumes. A primary benefit of logical volumes is resizability. As long as the volume group has free space, logical volumes can expand after creation to include more storage from the volume group.</p>

		</section>

		<section>
			<h2>LVM &amp; RAID</h2>
			<p>In Linux, the tool used to create and manage logical volumes and volume groups is LVM. Another common tool is Redundant Array of Independent Disks (RAID). RAID can take on many forms, and each form has a number. RAID 0 involves combining two physical volumes into one logical volume, called a stripe. RAID is somewhat more rigid than LVM, in that the RAID number determines the exact number of physical volumes and logical volumes. Additionally, the physical volumes in a RAID are commonly entire storage drives and not partitions. Users continue to use RAID in order to allow volumes to span multiple drives, but in order to gain additional flexibility, some users place the RAID volume in a volume group and allocate the storage to logical volumes.</p>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h2>File Systems</h2>
			<div class="flex-row">
				<div class="flex-item" style="max-width: 80%">
					<p>The physical or logical volume is formatted with a file system. Different operating systems support different file systems (NTFS for Windows, HFS+ for OS X, EXT4 for Linux, ZFS for BSD). Different file systems have different features for protecting against data loss (ZFS is the most advanced), but they all provide the hierarchical folder structure common in desktop operating systems. The operating system and other applications are stored on the file system. Because the file system is separate from the operating system, users can remove a storage drive from one computer and access the file system from another computer.</p>
				</div>

			</div>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h2>From File System to Database System</h2>
			<p>The role of a database system is to collate data and present it in a centralized manner. In the example of the library card catalog, a physical database system functions as an alternative to a file system. However, in digital storage, this is not the case. A digital database system is an application, which runs on an operating system, which sits on a file system. In the current computing world, database systems are not an alternative to file systems, rather they collate data stored on a file system and present it as if it were stored in a centralized manner. Many software applications are database systems. Music players are a common example. The individual song files are stored in separate files and folders on a file system. The music player collates the songs and provides the user with a single library.</p>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h2>Flat File Databases</h2>
			<p>The simplest databases are <u><em>flat files</em></u>. A flat file database is a single file that contains only data with each row representing a single record. Spreadsheets and comma- or tab-delimited files (CSV or TXT) are examples of flat files. In flat file databases, all data is stored in a single table. These are popular for storing small datasets because they place no restrictions on the form of the data. As a result, adding additional records tends to be quick and easy. Additionally, many users are familiar with applications that read flat files, such as Microsoft Excel. The largest drawback of flat files is an inability to create relationships between data in different tables. Additionally, flat file databases have none of the functionality necessary to support data integrity in a large-scale enterprise-grade information system.</p>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h2>Relational Databases</h2>
			<p>Many database systems for storing business data are relational databases. Each relational database contains one of more two-dimensional <em><u>tables</u></em>. The technical name for a table is a <u><em>relation</em></u>, hence <em>relational database</em>. These tables are similar to spreadsheets found in office software.</p>
			<div class="table">
				<div class="table-row" style="background-color: lightgray">

					<div class="table-cell">janine.cray@abc.xyz</div>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p>The individual rows in the relations are called <u><em>records</em></u> or <u><em>tuples</em></u>. The individual columns are called <u><em>attributes</em></u> or <em><u>fields</u></em>. The intersection of a row and a column is a <em><u>cell</u></em>. Cells hold a single value.</p>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h2>Data Types</h2>
			<p>All cells for a single attribute must have the same <u><em>data type</em></u>. This type determines the characteristics of the data, as well as any available operations.</p>
			<div class="table">
				<div class="table-row" style="background-color: lightgray">
					<div class="table-cell" style="font-weight: bold">Type name</div>

					<div class="table-cell">Year, month, and day</div>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p>Numerical data types support arithmetic and statistical functions, such as addition, subtraction, and average. String data types support pattern matching. Date types and numerical types both support comparisons (e.g., greater than or less than).</p>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h2>Database Records</h2>
			<p>The strength of a relational database is in the relationships between the database tables. Each table represents an entity (e.g., sales order), rows represents instances of an entity (e.g., a specific sales order), and columns represent attributes of the entity (e.g., sales order date). Relationships between tables represent interactions between entities. The relational database model stores data by entity while relating it to data from other entities. However, this also poses a weakness of the relational model. When adding data to a relational database, it can be necessary to add data to multiple tables. For example, if a customer places an order to be shipped to a new address, then the database would need to add a record to the customer order table, a record to the customer address table, and it would need to edit a record in the inventory table.</p>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h2>Structure Models for Relational Databases</h2>
			<ul>
				<li><u><em>Activity models</em></u> describe a series of processes that comprise a system. This system may be a computer program or a business cycle involving many programs and people.</li>
				<li><u><em>Structure models</em></u> describe the characteristics of people, assets, and data and their relationships with one another.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Relational databases are a popular context for discussing structure models because the models provide a conceptual view of data storage and identify what attributes are necessary prior to the implementation of the storage solution.</p>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h2>Why More Diagrams?</h2>
			<p>Once we know how to diagram business activities, why is it necessary to create <em>another</em> diagram about the objects in those activities?</p>
			<p>A process diagram identifies players (agents, processes, and data objects) in a system, but an information system needs more dimensionality. It needs the metadata about each item in the activity diagram. For example, an activity diagram may include the object Invoice, but the information system needs to know the particulars of each instance (i.e., occurrence) of Invoice (e.g., vendor, amount due, due date, etc.).</p>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h2>Entity-Relationship Diagrams</h2>
			<p>The entity-relationship model initially introduced by Peter Chen in 1976 is the <i>de facto</i> standard for modeling relational databases. As the name indicates, the components of an E-R diagram are <em><u>entities</u></em> and <em><u>relationships</u></em> between entities. Additionally, thorough diagrams also include a series of <em><u>attributes</u></em> for each entity and <em><u>cardinalities</u></em> of the relationships.</p>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h2>Entities</h2>
			<p>An <u><em>entity</em></u> is something of importance that needs to be represented in the database. Examples of an entity may be Employee, Invoice, Inventory, Time Stamp, etc. It is important to note that these entities are concepts and not instances. For example, Employee is an entity, but a particular employee, Joe Smith, is an instance of that entity. Entities correspond to tables in the database, whereas instances correspond to records in those tables.
		</section>

		<section>
			<h2>Relationships</h2>
			<p>A <u><em>relationship</em></u> is a link between entities. Because entities are nouns, relationships can be described as verbs of one entity acting on another. Examples of this would be the relationship of Employee and Purchase Requisition. These two entities have a relationship describable as: Employee Creates Purchase Requisition.</p>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h2>E-R Shapes</h2>
			<div class="flex-row">
				<div class="flex-item override">
					<div>E-R Diagram</div>

					<img src="../images/simple-chen-er.png" alt="Simple E-R Diagram with Chen Notation" style="max-height: 200px"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p>The rounded rectangles represent the entities, and the connecting lines signify relationships. Chen notation adds a diamond to allow for explicit labeling of relationships.</p>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h2>Attributes</h2>
			<p>An <u><em>attribute</em></u> is any relevant characteristic of an entity. Unsurprisingly, E-R attributes correspond to attributes in a relational table.</p>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h2>Cardinalities</h2>
			<p>The magnitude of the potential relationships between an instance of one entity and the instances of another (i.e., between a record of one table and the records of another table) is <u><em>cardinality</em></u>. Cardinalities have three potential values: zero, one, and many. Cardinalities also have two bounds: minimum and maximum. For example, if the two entities are Customer and Sale, then a customer is associated with at least (minimum) zero and at most (maximum) many sales, and each sale is associated with at least one customer and at most one customer. When the minimum and maximum cardinalities are equal, then it is only necessary to report one: each sale is associated with exactly one customer.</p>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h2>Coyne Rule of Zero</h2>
			<p>Although this is not a widely accepted rule of cardinalities, I believe that each relationship must have at least one minimum cardinality of zero. The reason for this is that the database can only create one record at a time. If a sale is associated with at least one customer, then the customer record must exist prior to the sale. If however, a customer is associated with at least one sale, as well, then the sale record must exist prior to the creation of the customer. However, they cannot both exist first. To avoid a Catch-22, one of the minimum cardinalities must be zero.</p>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h2>Exceptions to Entities and Attributes</h2>
			<p>Not everything that is important to represent is an entity, and not every relevant characteristic is an attribute. The exceptions to this rule are potential entities and attributes that are combinations of pre-existing attributes. One simple example of this relates to Inventory costs. Unit Cost and Quantity on Hand would be attributes of the entity Inventory, but Total Cost (= Unit Cost x Quantity on Hand) would not. Another example would be employee supervisors. Supervisor would not be an entity because it would simply be a subset of the Employee entity. These would-be entities and attributes become <em><u>user views</u></em> because they are not stored in the database but can be provided to the user, as needed.</p>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h2>Keys</h2>
			<p>A special subset of attributes that uniquely identifies a specific instance of an entity is a <u><em>primary key</em></u>. Each value of a primary key can only occur once per entity. Because these primary keys uniquely identify an instance, they also serve to link entities together to implement relationships. A primary key from one entity is included in another entity as a <u><em>foreign key</em></u> to create a link. For example, Employee might include Employee ID as a primary key, and Sales might include Employee ID as a foreign key to identify the employee responsible for the sale. The foreign key belongs to the entity that has the instance that is created last. For example, an employee exists before a time card, so the primary key from the Employee entity becomes a foreign key with the Time Card entity.</p>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h2>Composite Keys</h2>
			<p>Sometimes no single attribute uniquely identifies an instance of an entity. For example, neither Semester nor Year nor Course nor Section could be a primary key in a course schedule, but the combination of Semester and Year and Course and Section can. Primary keys that comprise multiple attributes are <u><em>composite keys</em></u>.</p>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h2>Sample Diagram</h2>
			<div class="flex-row">
				<div class="flex-item" style="max-width: 75%">
					<p>Each course in the catalog has a unique number and each professor a unique ID as primary key [PK]. These primary keys also link faculty and catalog entries to specific courses in the schedule through foreign keys [FK]. Schedule has a composite key, so course number is both a primary and a foreign key [PK/FK]. Each professor can teach zero or many scheduled courses, and each catalog entry can be scheduled zero or many times, but each scheduled course must have exactly one professor and one catalog reference.</p>

			<h2>Non-relational Databases</h2>
			<p>For several decades, RDBMSs have been the data store of choice for business data. However, Web commerce has created the need for database solutions that can add data quickly and can increase in size to accommodate very large datasets. These solutions fall into a class of non-relational databases, also called NoSQL (Not Only SQL). These databases abandon the principles of relational databases in favor of alternative models. One popular NoSQL model is the key-value store.</p>
			<p>A <u><em>key-value store</em></u> pairs unique keys with data objects. The data object can be anything from a single number to an entire file. The role of the key-value store is to facilitate efficient storing and retrieval of values (i.e., data objects) by their keys. Two types of key-value stores are document stores and column stores.</p>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h2>Document Store</h2>
			<p>A <em><u>document store</u></em> is a key-value store in which the &ldquo;value&rdquo; is a text file with multiple metadata attributes and values, frequently in XML, YAML, or JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) format. The document store is essentially a condensed version of a relational database, except that instead of storing the individual values as fields in a record of a relational table, the document store keeps all values together in a single field (i.e., the entire document).</p>

		<section>
			<h2>Column Store</h2>
			<p>A <u><em>column store</em></u> is a key-value store that groups key and values into columns and multiple key-value pairs into families, similar to rows in relational tables. Unlike relational tables, these "rows" can have different numbers of attributes (i.e., keys), and attributes that appear in multiple rows can have different data types.</p>

			<h2>Graph Database</h2>
			<div class="flex-row">
				<div class="flex-item" style="max-width: 55%">
					<p>With the advent of social media, a different type of NoSQL database has become increasingly popular. A <u><em>graph database</em></u> uses nodes, edges, and properties to emphasize the relationships between objects. Each node is an object similar to a row in a relational database, and each node can have one or more properties or attributes. Edges connect nodes to describe how nodes relate to one another.</p>

			<h2>Benefits of NoSQL Databases</h2>
			<ul>
				<li><u><em>Volume</em></u>: Because of the simplicity of each record in the database, NoSQL databases are designed to store many more records than their relational counterparts.</li>
				<li><u><em>Velocity</em></u>: Relational databases must find each field, perhaps across multiple tables, to add new records. NoSQL databases take the data input and simply append it to the end of the store.</li>
				<li><u><em>Variety</em></u>: Unlike relational databases which primarily store simple data types, NoSQL databases can store any data object. As a result, they are useful for pairing metadata with supporting documentation (e.g., invoice information with a scanned image of the original paper invoice).</li>
			</ul>

			<h2>Accounting Tie-in</h2>
			<p>Accountants have always had the responsibility to store economic data in journals and ledgers. As the world becomes more digital, databases have replaced paper journals and ledgers, but that is only the beginning. eCommerce and Big Data have created the need for faster, more scalable data stores so that firms can capture customer data as fast as the customers create it. Because of mobile devices, which soon will outnumber humans on earth, this data is created constantly.
