			<h3>Accounting Architecture</h3>
			<div class="flex-row">

				<div class="flex-item" style="max-width: 65%">
					<p>The Business Model includes an entity's operations, ownership and governance, financing, and investments. All of these aspects of the business model, especially the operations, impact the informational needs of the entity's stakeholders. As a result, a clear understanding of business cycles and processes is vital for implementing effective accounting architecture.</p>
				</div>
			</div>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h3>Informational Needs</h3>
			<p>The first step in designing any information system is understanding the informational needs of internal and external stakeholders, including managers, regulators, creditors, investors, etc. Because of their extensive financial, management, and tax accounting knowledge, accountants are well-equipped to identify all kinds informational needs. However, because each business is unique, a clear understanding of the business's processes is necessary in order to provide information relevant to a specific business model. This is especially true in the current Information Era because high-quality information provides competitive advantages like never before.</p>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h3>Business Processes</h3>
			<p>A <u><em>business process</em></u> is a series of tasks or activities that serve to transfer resources&mdash;goods, services, money and/or information&mdash;between two parties. The process begins with a pre-determined trigger event (e.g., receiving a sales order from a customer) and ends when the process objective (e.g., depositing customer payment) has been achieved. Additionally, a complete process will include the tasks necessary to record all accounting data about the process (e.g., increase in accounts receivable for a sale on credit).</p>
			<p>(NB: The word &ldquo;process&rdquo; can mean a series of tasks, but it may also be used to mean a task within a series. This ambiguity can be confusing.)</p>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h3>Common Processes</h3>
			<dl>
				<dt>Sales process</dt>
				<dd>Receiving orders from customers and providing goods and services to customers.</dd>
				<dt>Cash receipts process</dt>
				<dd>Receiving and depositing payments from customers, lenders, and investors.</dd>
				<dt>Purchase process</dt>
				<dd>Ordering and receiving goods and services from vendors.</dd>
				<dt>Cash payments process</dt>
				<dd>Receiving invoices and issuing payment.</dd>
				<dt>Payroll process</dt>
				<dd>Receiving time cards from employees and paying wages.</dd>
			</dl>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h3>Other Processes</h3>
			<p>Additional business processes might include:</p>
			<dl>
				<dt>Sales return process</dt>
				<dd>Receiving goods and/or refund requests from customers.</dd>
				<dt>Fixed asset process</dt>
				<dd>Tracking, maintaining, and depreciating long-term assets.</dd>
				<dt>Production process</dt>
				<dd>Converting raw materials into finished goods inventory.</dd>
				<dt>Financial reporting process</dt>
				<dd>End-of-period financial accounting procedures.</dd>
				<dt>Personnel process</dt>
				<dd>Employee hiring, training, retention, promotion, and termination.</dd>
			</dl>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h3>Business Cycles</h3>
			<p>Accountants frequently think of business operations in the context of <u><em>business cycles</em></u> or <u><em>transaction cycles</em></u>. Business cycles are a combination of related business processes. The most common business cycles are:</p>
			<dl>
				<dt>Revenue cycle</dt>
				<dd>Sales, sales return, and cash receipts processes.</dd>
				<dt>Expenditure cycle</dt>
				<dd>Purchase, cash payments, production, payroll, and fixed asset processes.</dd>
			</dl>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h3>Other Cycles</h3>
			<p>Classifying proccesses by transaction cycle is simply a matter of convenience. As a result, the same process can belong to multiple cycles, depending on scope. Additional cycles could include:</p>
			<dl>
				<dt>Cash cycle</dt>
				<dd>Cash receipts and cash payments processes.</dd>
				<dt>Conversion (or Inventory) cycle</dt>
				<dd>Purchase, production, and payroll processes.</dd>
				<dt>Investment cycle</dt>
				<dd>Cash receipts, cash payments, and fixed asset processes.</dd>
				<dt>HR cycle</dt>
				<dd>Personnel and payroll processes.</dd>
			</dl>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h3>Need for Flexibility</h3>
			<p>Accounting, tax, and auditing standards apply to different business models differently. Similarly, the identification of relevant business cycles also depends on the business model. For example, the conversion cycle (i.e., production of inventory) is not a relevant component of service-oriented business models, whereas given the significance of tax planning and compliance, a tax cycle might be an important additional business cycle. The processes and cycles listed here are merely examples, although some, such as those processes in the revenue and expenditure cycles, may be common across multiple business models. Accounting architecture must be specialized enough to accommodate the specific processes and cycles in an entity's business model.</p>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h3>Accounting Information</h3>
			<p>To accountants, the need for a financial reporting process, including internal audit and tax tasks, is an obvious part of the Compliance block of the Environment section of accounting architecture. The data for this financial reporting process (i.e., the data to create internal and external financial reports) comes from the other individual business processes. The recording tasks in these other processes serve to keep accounting records accurate and up-to-date. It is insufficient simply to assume that transactions will be recorded. These tasks must be an explicit part of any business process.</p>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h3>A Word on Ledgers</h3>
			<p>Accounting records are necessary. Financial accounting textbooks teach that &ldquo;accounting records&rdquo; means journals and ledgers. However, this is neither necessarily nor even likely the case. Journals and ledgers are merely an example of an information system. In fact, double-entry accounting is merely an example method for maintaining accounting records. The information system is not restricted to one form, and informational needs, technological feasibility, best practices, and preferences will dictate how to track accounting, tax, payroll, HR, etc., information.</p>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h3>Data &ne; Presentation</h3>
			<p>One of the reasons why accounting data is not restricted to the familiar journal and ledger form is that data is separate from presentation. For example, a journal is nothing more than a series of accounts with their associated debit or credit adjustments sorted by date, and a ledger is nothing more than the same list of accounts with their associated debits and credits sorted by account. They are simply two presentations of the same data, and in the case of digital data it would not be wise to store this data twice for the sole purpose of having the data presented in two different ways. Data is the relevant construct when measuring economic activities. Presentation is driven by the type of desired report. The journal model and the ledger model are simply types of reports.</p>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h3>Understanding the Processes</h3>
			<p>Although information systems and business processes are unique to each organization, familiarity with example processes and cycles makes adaptation to unique circumstances easier. (This is primary purpose of learning the concepts of accounting architecture. Familiarity with information principles, technologies, and controls is the first step toward adapting these concepts to a specific business model.) Additionally, the CPA exam covers business cycles and processes in, at least, the Auditing section.</p>
			<p>The primary tools for communicating the configuration of business processes are <u><em>diagrams</em></u>. As a result, the ability to read diagrams is a necessary precursor to learning a new process.</p>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h3>Diagrams</h3>
			<div class="flex-row">
				<div class="flex-item" style="max-width:50%">
					<p>A diagram is a visual representation of logic useful for efficient communication. Diagrams are not the only tool for communicating a series of processes, but drawings are more efficient than narrations. They are frequently easier to understand and interpret. Because they can portray multiple parts of the whole at once, they can identify links between objects.</p>

			<h3>Diagrams in Action</h3>
			<div class="flex-row" style="-webkit-justify-content: flex-start; justify-content: flex-start">
				<div class="flex-item" style="max-width: 90%"><blockquote>I'm going to make a flow process chart for each of the parts that make up the gun. These charts will show, step by step, how the part is made.<br>&ndash; Alan Mogensen to Remington Arms Company foreman</blockquote></div>
			</div>

				<div class="flex-item" style="max-width: 90%"><blockquote>I made the chart, and I found out that we were doing some dumb stupid things that I didn't realize we were doing so we're fixing them.<br>&ndash; Remington Arms Company foreman to Alan Mogensen</blockquote></div>
			</div>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h3>Two Types of Models</h3>
			<p><u><em>Activity models</em></u> describe a series of tasks that comprise a system. This system may be a computer program or a business process or cycle involving many programs and people, called agents. Activity models track flow of resources, data, and control. Information systems focus on data flow, but control flow is also important.</p>
			<p><u><em>Structure models</em></u> describe the characteristics of people, assets, and data and their relationships with one another. Structure models are useful for creating conceptual models of data stores.</p>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h3>Activity Model</h3>
			<div class="flex-row">
				<div class="flex-item override"><img src="../images/accounting-curriculum.png" alt="Undergraduate Accounting Curriculum" style="max-height: 600px"/></div>
				<div class="flex-item" style="max-width:50%">
					<p>A curriculum plan is a simple example of an activity model. Passing a course represents one task, and the model demonstrates how to navigate the entire degree process. This model contains no data objects, so the purpose of the arrows is to demonstrate which tasks must precede others. This is an example of control flow.</p>
				</div>
			</div>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h3>Control Flow</h3>
			<p><u><em>Control flow</em></u> determines which tasks in a process may execute in which order. A traditional card game illustrates this principle. If one turn involves (1) requesting cards and (2) placing a bet, then the requesting cards activity must be complete before placing a bet, and both activities must complete before the next player can have a turn. The current task has control, and when it completes, control is passed to the next task.</p>
			<p>(NB: Accountants frequently refer to &ldquo;controls&rdquo; or &ldquo;internal controls.&rdquo; These terms are unrelated to control flow. They are part to the Control section of accounting architecture.)</p>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h3>Data Flow</h3>
			<p>The purpose of many process tasks, especially recording tasks familiar to accountants, is to create data. <u><em>Data flow</em></u> tracks data creation, use, and storage by identifying which task creates the data, which tasks use the data, and where the data is stored. A straightforward example would be a sample sales order process. The customer contacts the sales rep to place an order; the sales rep creates a sales order that the inventory warehouse uses to fill the order; the warehouse passes the sales order to the billing department, so that the billing department can create an invoice to send to the customer.</p>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h3>Modeling Standards</h3>
			<p>Sometimes, in order to quickly communicate processes, individuals may draft ad-hoc activity diagrams with arbitrary shapes, just as individuals or groups may invent words or phrases to communicate complex concepts. However, many activity diagrams adhere to specific frameworks with that templates (i.e., predefined sets of shapes). These frameworks serve to make the diagrams more widely understood. Two well-known diagramming frameworks are:</p>
			<ul style="display: inline-block">
				<li>Data flow diagrams</li>
				<li>Flowcharts</li>
			</ul>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h3>Data Flow Diagrams</h3>
			<div class="flex-row">
				<div class="flex-item" style="max-width: 55%">
					<p>Data flow diagrams (DFDs) are one of the simplest forms of diagrams. They use only three shapes, along with arrows to show flow. Two different groups introduced nearly identical templates for DFDs:</p>
					<p>(NB: This is an example of the multiple uses of &ldquo;process.&rdquo; The whole DFD describes a business process, and the process shape shows one task within the business process.)</p>
				</div>
				<div class="flex-item override"><img src="../images/dfd.png" alt="DFD Template"/></div>
			</div>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h3>Sample DFD</h3>
			<div class="override"><img src="../images/sample-dfd.png" alt="Sample DFD"/></div>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h3>Narrative</h3>
				<p>The vendor sends an invoice. The invoice is compared to the purchase order for discrepancies. If the invoice and the purchase order agree, the invoice is approved and added to the invoice file. A check is prepared from the data in the invoice file and sent to the vendor. The check stub is used to update the cash payments file, and the check stub is filed by vendor and date.</p>
				<p>(NB: These files may be either digital or physical. For example, the check stub file may be a physical file with printed check stubs, whereas the invoice file is likely a database table with the information from approved invoices.)</p>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h3>DFD Conventions</h3>
			<p>In addition to a set of prescribed shapes, diagramming frameworks may also stipulate drawing conventions. For example:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Flow of data and control (i.e., flowlines) is signified by arrows with arrowheads.</li>
				<li>Because DFDs have no data shapes other than data stores, the data transfered from step to step is displayed as a label next to the arrow between the two steps.</li>
				<li>Gane-Sarson flowlines only point vertically or horizontally with 90&deg; angles, but Yourdon flowlines can point in any direction and even curve.</li>
			</ul>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h3>Simplicity &ne; Readability</h3>
			<p>Data flow diagrams promote simplicity by restricting themselves to three shapes. Other diagramming frameworks with larger templates can result in cluttered diagrams, which reduces readability. However, simplicity will not always increase readability. For example, the lack of predetermined direction for DFDs conflicts with a preference to read from top to bottom and left to right. Additionally, DFDs have no mechanism for communicating accountability (i.e., who performs a task), which is important information for accountants and auditors. As a result, DFDs may be better for a high-level overview, instead of a detailed perspective.</p>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h3>Types of Flowcharts</h3>
			<p>Flowcharts are one of the oldest diagramming frameworks and, perhaps, also the most common. Although they are more complex than DFDs, they can provide more relevant information about a business process. The two primary types of flowcharts are:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><u><em>System flowcharts</em></u> show data and control flow through a system from origin through processing to final disposition.</li>
				<li><u><em>Program flowcharts</em></u> show logic and control flow in a program, usually a computer program.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>System flowcharts are for business processes. However, because of the current reliance on digital systems, program flowcharts can be a valuable tool for diagramming automated tasks.</p>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h3>Common Flowchart Shapes</h3>
			<div class="override"><img src="../images/flowchart.png" alt="Flowchart Shapes"/></div>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h3>Sample Flowchart</h3>
				<div class="override"><img src="../images/sample-flowchart.png" alt="Sample Flowchart" style="max-height: 600px"/></div>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h3>Narrative</h3>
			<p>Inventory Control reviews inventory levels and generates a purchase requisition for inventory. (This might occur if inventory has fallen below its reorder point.) Inventory Control then files a copy of the purchase requisition and sends a copy to the Purchasing Department. The Purchasing Department generates a purchase order, files a copy of the purchase order with the purchase requisition, sends a copy of the purchase order to Inventory Control to file with Inventory Control's copy of the purchase requisition, and sends a copy of the purchase order to the Vendor.</p>
			<p>(NB: This flowchart demonstrates a paper-based system, but the process would be only marginally different if the purchase requisition and purchase orders were digital.)</p>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h3>Flowchart Conventions</h3>
			<p>Flowcharts have more shapes in their template than DFDs, and they also have more specific drawing conventions. Because of the high number of shapes in a flowchart, these conventions can significantly increase readability:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Flowcharts are read from top to bottom and left to right.</li>
				<li>Flow of data and control is signified by arrows with arrowheads.</li>
				<li>Flowlines should only point vertically or horizontally with 90&deg; angles. Arrows should also not cross. Connectors serve to link process steps when unbroken flowlines are not possible.</li>
				<li>For system flowcharts with multiple agents, flowcharts are subdivided into swimlanes (i.e., columns that signify which activities belong to which agent).</li>
			</ul>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h3>Sales Process</h3>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h3>High-level Information Flows</h3>
			<div class="override"><img src="../images/dfd-cycles.png" alt="Cycles"/></div>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h3>Walkthough</h3>
			<p>This DFD highlights a number of informational needs connected with revenue-generating activities, which are grouped together into one high-level Revenue Cycle object. The arrows and their labels represent information flows. Related flows of resources may also occur (e.g., Bank receives information regarding deposits, as well as the deposits themselves), but this diagram focuses on informational needs. Some of the flows in this diagram are intuitive: banks receive deposit information and send statements; customers send orders, payment information, return requests, and customer inquiries, and they receive invoices, delivery information, and responses to inquiries.</p>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h3>Additional Flows</h3>
			<p>Other information flows include:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>The expenditure cycle (for firms that acquire goods and services to sell) or the production cycle (for firms that create goods and services to sell) receives information regarding consumed resources from the revenue cycle and a forecast of resources to procure from marketing and sends the cost of sales to financial reporting, consumed employee time to payroll, and orders to vendors. Vendors provide invoices in return.</li>
				<li>The revenue cycle provides sales information to marketing and financial reporting and receives recommended prices from marketing.</li>
			</ol>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h3>Big Data and Data Analytics</h3>
			<p>With the advent of Big Data and the belief that the secrets to additional profitability lie hidden therein, additional information flows have arisen. For example, marketing may now collect various types of information from customers, such as Web site visits. Additionally, the rise in data analytics has also created, or promised to create, additional internal flows of information regarding firm strategy. For example, the tax function can use knowledge of tax policy and analysis of past sales and Big Data to identify strategies to report to the expenditure or production cycle or marketing.</p>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h3>Feedback Loop</h3>
			<p>These cases of the impact of Big Data and data analytics on information flows highlights one important role of the information system: to provide feedback on the business model. In the accounting architecture arch, Business Model is a foundational block because the information system should adhere to role of measuring and reporting on the existing business. However, as it reports on the existing business, the external environment, and organizational capabilities, the information system should affect the future business model by determining new strategies. The information system should not limit itself to reporting on past activities.</p>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h3>One Example</h3>
			<p>The purpose for providing this graphical representation of information flows is to provide a context and an application for identifying the informational needs of various internal and external stakeholders. This is <em>not</em> the model of a particular firm's cycles. It is simply an example in order to increase understanding of potential information flows. Just as diagrams are useful for communication in business, this example diagram serves to communicate information needs in a concise fashion. Implementing these principles in a different business setting merely involves recognizing how the concepts apply to another application.</p>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h3>Accounting Tie-in</h3>
			<p>Traditional accounting curriculum focuses exclusively on the information flows into the financial reporting and tax functions. However, this is not an appropriate view of the information stewardship of accountants. In practice, accountants are involved with measurement and reporting activities associated with each of the information flows and functions depicted in this diagram. Marketing uses accountants, payroll and HR use accountants, production uses accountants, sales uses accountants. The purpose of accounting architecture is not only to support the financial reporting function, but rather to support the measurement and reporting needs of all business activities. These are some less obvious, but important, examples:</p>
		</section>
