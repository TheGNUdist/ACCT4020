			<h3>Accounting Architecture</h3>
			<div class="flex-row">

				<div class="flex-item" style="max-width: 65%">
					<p>The Business Model includes an entity's operations, ownership and financing, governance, and investments. All of these aspects of the business model, especially the operations, impact the informational needs of the entity's stakeholders. As a result, a clear understanding of business cycles and processes is vital for implementing effective accounting architecture.</p>
				</div>
			</div>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h3>Informational Needs</h3>
			<p>The first step in designing any information system is understanding the informational needs of internal and external stakeholders, including managers, regulators, creditors, investors, etc. Because of their extensive financial, management, and tax accounting knowledge, accountants are well-equipped to identify all kinds informational needs. However, because each business is unique, a clear understanding of the business's processes is necessary in order to provide information relevant to a specific business model. This is especially true in the current Information Era because high-quality information provides competitive advantages like never before.</p>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h3>Business Processes</h3>
			<p>A <u><em>business process</em></u> is a series of tasks or activities that serve to transfer resources between two parties. The process begins with a pre-determined trigger event (e.g., receiving a sales order from a customer) and ends when the process objective (e.g., depositing customer payment) has been achieved. For accountants, the &ldquo;recording&rdquo; tasks in each process are vital because these are the steps in the process that serve to keep the accounting records accurate and up-to-date. It is insufficient simply to assume that transactions will be recorded. These tasks must be an explicit part of any business process.</p>
			<p>(NB: The word &ldquo;process&rdquo; can mean a series of tasks, but it may also be used mean a task within a series. This can be confusing.)</p>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h3>Common Processes</h3>
			<dl>
				<dt>Sales process</dt>
				<dd>Receiving orders from customers and providing goods and services to customers.</dd>
				<dt>Cash receipts process</dt>
				<dd>Receiving and depositing payments from customers, lenders, and investors.</dd>
				<dt>Purchase process</dt>
				<dd>Ordering and receiving goods and services from vendors.</dd>
				<dt>Cash payments process</dt>
				<dd>Receiving invoices and issuing payment.</dd>
				<dt>Payroll process</dt>
				<dd>Receiving time cards from employees and paying wages.</dd>
			</dl>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h3>Other Processes</h3>
			<p>Additional business processes might include:</p>
			<dl>
				<dt>Sales return process</dt>
				<dd>Receiving goods and/or refund requests from customers.</dd>
				<dt>Fixed asset process</dt>
				<dd>Tracking, maintaining, and depreciating long-term assets.</dd>
				<dt>Production process</dt>
				<dd>Converting raw materials into finished goods inventory.</dd>
				<dt>Financial reporting process</dt>
				<dd>End-of-period financial accounting procedures.</dd>
				<dt>Personnel process</dt>
				<dd>Employee hiring, training, retention, promotion, and termination.</dd>
			</dl>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h3>Business Cycles</h3>
			<p>Accountants frequently think of business operations in the context of <u><em>business cycles</em></u> or <u><em>transaction cycles</em></u>. Business cycles are a combination of related business processes. The most common business cycles are:</p>
			<dl>
				<dt>Revenue cycle</dt>
				<dd>Sales, sales return, and cash receipts processes.</dd>
				<dt>Expenditure cycle</dt>
				<dd>Purchase, cash payments, production, payroll, and fixed asset processes.</dd>
			</dl>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h3>Other Cycles</h3>
			<p>Classifying proccesses by transaction cycle is simply a matter of convenience. As a result, the same process can belong to multiple cycles, depending on scope. Additional cycles could include:</p>
			<dl>
				<dt>Cash cycle</dt>
				<dd>Cash receipts and cash payments processes.</dd>
				<dt>Conversion (or Inventory) cycle</dt>
				<dd>Purchase, production, and payroll processes.</dd>
				<dt>Investment cycle</dt>
				<dd>Cash receipts, cash payments, and fixed asset processes.</dd>
				<dt>HR cycle</dt>
				<dd>Personnel and payroll processes.</dd>
			</dl>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h3>Need for Flexibility</h3>
			<p>Just as financial accounting, tax, and auditing standards reflect differences in business models between companies and industries, the identification of relevant business cycles is also unique. For example, the production of inventory or fixed assets is no longer a relevant component of many business models, whereas given the importance of corporate taxes, a tax cycle might manifest. In a services firm, such as is common to public accounting, the distinction between the expenditure and payroll cycles may be negligent because employees are the primary assets of the firm. A company that deals primarily in the creation of open source software might not even have a revenue cycle.</p>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h3>A Word on Ledgers</h3>
			<p>Regulation&mdash;part of the Compliance block of the architecture&mdash;dictates the reporting of financial items in a specific fashion without much room for flexibility. As a result, a financial reporting cycle is vital, at least for public companies. (Because lenders may also require financial disclosures&mdash;another component of the Compliance block&mdash;the need for a financial reporting cycle is not unique to public companies.) However, that is not a prescription to have a general ledger or general ledger cycle. Journals and ledgers are merely an example of an information system. The information system is not restricted to one form, and informational needs, technological feasibility, best practices, and preferences will dictate how to track accounting, tax, payroll, HR, etc., information.</p>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h3>Data &ne; Presentation</h3>
			<p>One of the reasons why accounting data is not restricted to the familiar journal and ledger form is that data is separate from presentation. For example, a journal is nothing more than a series of accounts with their associated debit or credit adjustments sorted by date, and a ledger is nothing more than the same list of accounts with their associated debits and credits sorted by account. They are simply two presentations of the same data, and several other presentations could also be acceptable. Data is the relevant construct when measuring economic activities.</p>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h3>What's the Point?</h3>
			<p>If information systems and business processes are unique to each organization, what is the point of teaching anything? It may not be possible to answer this question satisfactorily, but the truth is that an understanding of principles and examples makes it easier to adapt to unique situations in the future, so the goal becomes to provide exposure to new ideas, and open the door towards being able to acquire additional information about specific implementations.</p>
			<p>The tool to enable future learning about information systems is knowledge of the individual building blocks, and this is the focus of the accounting architecture. The tool to enable future learning about business models is the ability to read diagrams.</p>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h3>Diagram</h3>
			<div class="flex-row">
				<div class="flex-item" style="max-width:50%">
					<p>A diagram is a visual representation of logic useful for efficient communication. Diagrams are not the only tool for communicating a series of processes, but drawings are more efficient than narrations. They are frequently easier to understand and interpret. Because they can portray multiple parts of the whole at once, they can identify links between objects.</p>

		<section>
			<h3>Diagrams in Action</h3>
			<div class="flex-row" style="-webkit-justify-content: flex-start; justify-content: flex-start">
				<div class="flex-item" style="max-width: 90%"><blockquote>I'm going to make a flow process chart for each of the parts that make up the gun. These charts will show, step by step, how the part is made.<br>&ndash; Alan Mogensen</blockquote></div>
			</div>

				<div class="flex-item" style="max-width: 90%"><blockquote>I made the chart, and I found out that we were doing some dumb stupid things that I didn't realize we were doing so we're fixing them.<br>&ndash; Remington Arms Company foreman</blockquote></div>
			</div>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h3>Two Types of Models</h3>
			<ul>
				<li><u><em>Activity models</em></u> describe a series of tasks that comprise a system. This system may be a computer program or a business process or cycle involving many programs and people, called agents. Activity models track flow of resources, data, and control. Information systems focus on data flow, but control flow is also important.</li>
				<li><u><em>Structure models</em></u> describe the characteristics of people, assets, and data and their relationships with one another. Structure models are useful for creating conceptual models of data stores.</li>
			</ul>
			<p></p>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h3>Activity Model</h3>
			<div class="flex-row">
				<div class="flex-item"><img src="../images/accounting-curriculum.png" alt="Undergraduate Accounting Curriculum" style="max-height: 600px"/></div>
				<div class="flex-item" style="max-width:50%">
					<p>A curriculum plan is a simple example of an activity model. Passing a course represents one task, and the model demonstrates how to navigate the entire degree process. This model contains no data objects, so the purpose of the arrows is to demonstrate which tasks must precede others. This is an example of control flow.</p>
				</div>
			</div>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h3>Control Flow</h3>
			<p><u><em>Control flow</em></u> determines which tasks in a process may execute in which order. A traditional card game illustrates this principle. If one turn involves (1) requesting cards and (2) placing a bet, then the requesting cards activity must complete before placing a bet, and both activities must complete before the next player can have a turn. The current task has control, and when it completes, control is passed to the next task.</p>
			<p>(The accounting architecture arch has a Control section, but this is a different use of the word.)</p>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h3>Data Flow</h3>
			<p>Data flow is simpler to understand than control flow. The purpose of many process tasks, especially the measurement and reporting tasks familiar to accountants, is to create data. Data flow tracks data creation, use, and storage by identifying which task creates the data, which tasks use the data, and where the data is stored. A straightforward example would be a sample sales order process. The customer contacts the sales rep to place an order; the sales rep creates a sales order that the inventory warehouse uses to fill the order; the warehouse passes the sales order to billing department, so that the billing department can create an invoice to send to the customer.</p>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h3>Modeling Standards</h3>
			<p>In order to understand the principles of data and control flow, it is best to view actual diagrams. The curriculum diagram is a rudimentary example, but many diagrams adhere to specific frameworks that include templates (i.e., predefined sets of shapes), and it is necessary to recognize these shapes in order to be able to read and write proper diagrams. Three well-known examples are of diagramming frameworks are:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Flowcharts</li>
				<li>Data flow diagrams (DFD)</li>
				<li>Business Process Model and Notation (BPMN)</li>
			</ul>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h3>Flowchart Shapes</h3>
			<div class="override"><img src="../images/Flowchart.png" alt="Flowchart Shapes"/></div>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h3>Sample Flowchart</h3>
			<div class="override"></div>
			<div class="flex-row">
				<div class="flex-item override"><img src="../images/sample-flowchart.png" alt="Sample Flowchart"/></div>
				<div class="flex-item" style="max-width: 70%">
					<p>Inventory Control reviews inventory levels and generates a purchase requisition for inventory. (This might occur if inventory has fallen below its reorder point.) Inventory Control then files a copy of the purchase requisition and sends a copy to the Purchasing Department. The Purchasing Department generates a purchase order, files a copy of the purchase order with the purchase requisition, sends a copy of the purchase order to Inventory Control to file with Inventory Control's copy of the purchase requisition, and sends a copy of the purchase order to the Vendor.</p>
				</div>
			</div>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h3>Flowchart Conventions</h3>
			<p>In addition to a set of prescribed shapes, diagramming frameworks also stipulate drawing conventions to increase readability. For example:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Flowcharts are read from top to bottom and left to right.</li>
				<li>Flow of data and control is signified by arrows with arrowheads.</li>
				<li>Arrows should only point vertically or horizontally with 90&deg; angles.</li>
				<li>For system flowcharts with multiple agents, flowcharts are subdivided into swimlanes, which are columns that signify which activities belong to which agent.</li>
			</ul>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h3>Data Flow Diagrams</h3>
			<p>Two different groups introduced nearly identical templates for DFDs:</p>
			<div class="override"><img src="../images/DFD.png" alt="DFD Shapes"/></div>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h3>Sample DFD</h3>
			<div class="flex-row">
				<div class="flex-item override"><img src="../images/sample-dfd.png" alt="Sample DFD"/></div>
				<div class="flex-item" style="max-width: 41%">
					<p>The Vendor sends an invoice. The invoice is compared to the purchase order for discrepancies. Once the invoice is approved, a check is signed and sent to the Vendor. A journal entry is added to the cash disbursements journal, and a journal voucher is used to update the accounts payable subledger.</p>
				</div>
			</div>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h3>DFD Conventions</h3>
			<ul>
				<li>Flow of data and control is signified by arrows with arrowheads just as with flowcharts.</li>
				<li>Because DFDs have no data shapes other than data stores, the data transfered from step to step is displayed as a label next to the arrow between the two steps.</li>
				<li>Gane-Sarson arrows only point vertically or horizontally with 90&deg; angles, but Yourdon arrows can point in any direction and even curve.</li>
				<li>DFDs have no predetermined direction or swimlanes.</li>
			</ul>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h3>Simplicity &ne; Readability</h3>
			<p>Unlike flowcharts which have a large set of shapes to increase specificity, data flow diagrams promote simplicity by restricting themselves to three simple shapes. The large flowchart template can result in a cluttered diagram, which reduces readability. However, simplicity will not always increase readability. For example, the lack of predetermined direction for DFDs conflicts with a preference to read from top to bottom and left to right. Additionally, the lack of swimlanes obscures accountability (i.e., who performs a task), which is important information for accountants and auditors. As a result, DFDs are better for high-level and flowcharts better for low-level perspectives.</p>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h3>Business Process Model and Notation</h3>
			<p>Business Process Model and Notation (BPMN) is an attempt to create a modeling notation specifically for business processes. BPMN comprises multiple diagram types, and these different types follow different conventions and rely on different templates. Two examples are <u><em>collaborations</em></u>, which are similar to flowcharts and <u><em>choreographies</em></u>, which are similar to DFDs.</p>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h3>Ad-hoc</h3>
			<p>The ability to read and write flowcharts and DFDs provides a valuable basis for understanding and communicating business processes, a basis which is not necessarily improved by exposure to yet another diagramming framework. Part of the reason for this is that when attempting to describe a process, individuals may create diagrams on the spot that follow no prescribed framework. The measure of a diagram is not its adherence to templates, but rather its ability to share information. The skill of reading and writing flowcharts and DFDs simply increases the likelihood of being able to create and read useful diagrams.</p>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h3>High-level Information Flows</h3>
			<div class="override"><img src="../images/dfd-cycles.png" alt="Cycles"/></div>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h3>Walkthough</h3>
			<p>This DFD highlights a number of informational needs connected with revenue-generating activities, which are grouped together into one high-level Revenue Cycle object. The arrows and their labels represent information flows. Related flows of resources may also occur (e.g., Bank receives information regarding deposits, as well as the deposits themselves), but this diagram focuses on informational needs. Some of the flows in this diagram are intuitive: banks receive deposit information and send statements; customers send orders, payment information, return requests, and customer inquiries, and they receive invoices, delivery information, and responses to inquiries.</p>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h3>Additional Flows</h3>
			<p>Other information flows include:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>The expenditure cycle (for firms that acquire goods and services to sell) or the production cycle (for firms that create goods and services to sell) receives information regarding consumed resources from the revenue cycle and a forecast of resources to procure from marketing and sends the cost of sales to financial reporting, consumed employee time to payroll, and orders to vendors. Vendors provide invoices in return.</li>
				<li>The revenue cycle provides sales information to marketing and financial reporting and receives recommended prices from marketing.</li>
			</ol>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h3>Big Data and Data Analytics</h3>
			<p>With the advent of Big Data and the belief that the secrets to additional profitability lie hidden therein, additional information flows have arisen. For example, marketing may now collect various types of information from customers, such as Web site visits. Additionally, the rise in data analytics has also created, or promised to create, additional internal flows of information regarding firm strategy. For example, the tax function can use knowledge of tax policy and analysis of past sales and Big Data to identify strategies to report to the expenditure or production cycle or marketing.</p>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h3>Feedback Loop</h3>
			<p>These cases of the impact of Big Data and data analytics on information flows highlights one important role of the information system: to provide feedback on the business model. In the accounting architecture arch, Business Model is a foundational block because the information system should adhere to role of measuring and reporting on the existing business. However, as it reports on the existing business, the external environment, and organizational capabilities, the information system should affect the future business model by determining new strategies. The information system should not limit itself to reporting on past activities.</p>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h3>One Example</h3>
			<p>The purpose for providing this graphical representation of information flows is to provide a context and an application for identifying the informational needs of various internal and external stakeholders. This is <em>not</em> the model of a particular firm's cycles. It is simply an example in order to increase understanding of potential information flows. Just as diagrams are useful for communication in business, this example diagram serves to communicate information needs in a concise fashion. Implementing these principles in a different business setting merely involves recognizing how the concepts apply to another application.</p>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h3>Accounting Tie-in</h3>
			<p>Traditional accounting curriculum focuses exclusively on the information flows into the financial reporting and tax functions. However, this is not an appropriate view of the information stewardship of accountants. In practice, accountants are involved with measurement and reporting activities associated with each of the information flows and functions depicted in this diagram. Marketing uses accountants, payroll and HR use accountants, production uses accountants, sales uses accountants. The purpose of accounting architecture is not only to support the financial reporting function, but rather to support the measurement and reporting needs of all business activities. These are some less obvious, but important, examples:</p>
		</section>
