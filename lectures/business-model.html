      <h2>Accounting Architecture</h2>
      <div class="flex-row">
        <div class="flex-item override"><img src="../images/arch.png" alt="Accounting Architecture Model" style="max-width: 300px"/></div>
        <div class="flex-item" style="max-width: 65%">
          <p>The Business Model includes an entity's operations, ownership and governance, financing, and investments. All of these aspects of the business model, especially the operations, impact the informational needs of the entity's stakeholders. As a result, a clear understanding of business cycles and processes is vital for implementing effective accounting architecture.</p>
        </div>
      </div>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Informational Needs</h2>
      <p>The first step in designing any information system is understanding the informational needs of internal and external stakeholders, including managers, regulators, creditors, investors, etc. Because of their extensive financial, management, and tax accounting knowledge, accountants are well-equipped to identify all kinds of informational needs. However, because each business is unique, a clear understanding of the business's processes is necessary in order to provide information relevant to a specific business model. This is especially true in the current Information Era because high-quality information provides competitive advantages like never before.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Business Processes</h2>
      <p>A <u><em>business process</em></u> is a series of tasks or activities that serve to transfer resources&mdash;goods, services, money and/or information&mdash;between two parties. The process begins with a pre-determined trigger event (e.g., receiving a sales order from a customer) and ends when the process objective (e.g., depositing customer payment) has been achieved. Additionally, a complete process will include the tasks necessary to record all accounting data about the process (e.g., increase in accounts receivable for a sale on credit).</p>
      <p>(NB: The word &ldquo;process&rdquo; can mean a series of tasks, but it may also be used to mean a task within a series. This ambiguity can be confusing.)</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Common Processes</h2>
      <dl>
        <dt>Sales process</dt>
        <dd>Receiving orders from customers and providing goods and services to customers.</dd>
        <dt>Cash receipts process</dt>
        <dd>Receiving and depositing payments from customers, lenders, and investors.</dd>
        <dt>Purchase process</dt>
        <dd>Ordering and receiving goods and services from vendors.</dd>
        <dt>Payments process</dt>
        <dd>Receiving invoices and issuing payment.</dd>
        <dt>Payroll process</dt>
        <dd>Receiving time cards from employees and paying wages.</dd>
      </dl>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Other Processes</h2>
      <p>Additional business processes might include:</p>
      <dl>
        <dt>Sales return process</dt>
        <dd>Receiving goods and/or refund requests from customers.</dd>
        <dt>Fixed asset process</dt>
        <dd>Tracking, maintaining, and depreciating long-term assets.</dd>
        <dt>Production process</dt>
        <dd>Converting raw materials into finished goods inventory.</dd>
        <dt>Financial reporting process</dt>
        <dd>End-of-period financial accounting procedures.</dd>
        <dt>Personnel process</dt>
        <dd>Employee hiring, training, retention, promotion, and termination.</dd>
      </dl>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Business Cycles</h2>
      <p>Accountants frequently think of business operations in the context of <u><em>business cycles</em></u> or <u><em>transaction cycles</em></u>. Business cycles are a combination of related business processes. The most common business cycles are:</p>
      <dl>
        <dt>Revenue cycle</dt>
        <dd>Sales, sales return, and cash receipts processes.</dd>
        <dt>Expenditure cycle</dt>
        <dd>Purchase, payments, production, payroll, and fixed asset processes.</dd>
      </dl>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Other Cycles</h2>
      <p>Classifying proccesses by transaction cycle is simply a matter of convenience. As a result, the same process can belong to multiple cycles, depending on scope. Additional cycles could include:</p>
      <dl>
        <dt>Cash cycle</dt>
        <dd>Cash receipts and payments processes.</dd>
        <dt>Conversion (or Inventory) cycle</dt>
        <dd>Purchase, production, and payroll processes.</dd>
        <dt>Investment cycle</dt>
        <dd>Cash receipts, payments, and fixed asset processes.</dd>
        <dt>HR cycle</dt>
        <dd>Personnel and payroll processes.</dd>
      </dl>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Need for Flexibility</h2>
      <p>Accounting, tax, and auditing standards apply to different business models differently. Similarly, the identification of relevant business cycles also depends on the business model. For example, the conversion cycle (i.e., production of inventory) is not a relevant component of service-oriented business models, whereas given the significance of tax planning and compliance, a tax cycle might be an important additional business cycle. The processes and cycles listed here are merely examples, although some, such as those processes in the revenue and expenditure cycles, may be common across multiple business models. Accounting architecture must be specialized enough to accommodate the specific processes and cycles in an entity's business model.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Accounting Information</h2>
      <p>To accountants, the need for a financial reporting process, including internal audit and tax tasks, is an obvious part of the Compliance block of the Environment section of accounting architecture. The data for this financial reporting process (i.e., the data to create internal and external financial reports) comes from the other individual business processes. The recording tasks in these other processes serve to keep accounting records accurate and up-to-date. It is insufficient simply to assume that transactions will be recorded. These tasks must be an explicit part of any business process.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>A Word on Ledgers</h2>
      <p>Accounting records are necessary. Financial accounting textbooks teach that &ldquo;accounting records&rdquo; means journals and ledgers. However, this is neither necessarily nor even likely the case. Journals and ledgers are merely an example of an information system. In fact, double-entry accounting is merely an example method for maintaining accounting records. The information system is not restricted to one form, and informational needs, technological feasibility, best practices, and preferences will dictate how to track accounting, tax, payroll, HR, etc., information.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Data &ne; Presentation</h2>
      <p>One of the reasons why accounting data is not restricted to the familiar journal and ledger form is that data is separate from presentation. For example, a journal is nothing more than a series of accounts with their associated debit or credit adjustments sorted by date, and a ledger is nothing more than the same list of accounts with their associated debits and credits sorted by account. They are simply two presentations of the same data, and in the case of digital data it would not be wise to store this data twice for the sole purpose of having the data presented in two different ways. Data is the relevant construct when measuring economic activities. Presentation is driven by the type of desired report. The journal model and the ledger model are simply types of reports.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Understanding the Processes</h2>
      <p>Although information systems and business processes are unique to each organization, familiarity with example processes and cycles makes adaptation to unique circumstances easier. (This is the primary purpose of learning the concepts of accounting architecture. Familiarity with information principles, technologies, and controls is the first step toward adapting these concepts to a specific business model.) Additionally, the CPA exam covers business cycles and processes in, at least, the Auditing section.</p>
      <p>The primary tools for communicating the configuration of business processes are <u><em>diagrams</em></u>. As a result, the ability to read diagrams is a necessary precursor to learning a new process.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Diagrams</h2>
      <div class="flex-row">
        <div class="flex-item" style="max-width:50%">
          <p>A diagram is a visual representation of logic useful for efficient communication. Diagrams are not the only tool for communicating a series of processes, but drawings are more efficient than narrations. They are frequently easier to understand and interpret. Because they can portray multiple parts of the whole at once, they can identify links between objects.</p>

      <h2>Diagrams in Action</h2>
      <div class="flex-row" style="-webkit-justify-content: flex-start; justify-content: flex-start">
        <div class="flex-item" style="max-width: 90%"><blockquote>I'm going to make a flow process chart for each of the parts that make up the gun. These charts will show, step by step, how the part is made.<br>&ndash; Alan Mogensen to Remington Arms Company foreman</blockquote></div>

      </div>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Two Types of Models</h2>
      <p><u><em>Activity models</em></u> describe a series of tasks that comprise a system. This system may be a computer program or a business process or cycle involving many programs and people, called agents. Activity models track flow of resources, data, and control. Information systems focus on data flow, but control flow is also important.</p>
      <p><u><em>Structure models</em></u> describe the characteristics of people, assets, and data and their relationships with one another. Structure models are useful for creating conceptual models of data stores.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Activity Model</h2>
      <div class="flex-row">
        <div class="flex-item override"><img src="../images/accounting-curriculum.png" alt="Undergraduate Accounting Curriculum" style="max-height: 600px"/></div>
        <div class="flex-item" style="max-width:50%">
          <p>A curriculum plan is a simple example of an activity model. Passing a course represents one task, and the model demonstrates how to navigate the entire degree process. This model contains no data objects, so the purpose of the arrows is to demonstrate which tasks must precede others. This is an example of control flow.</p>
        </div>
      </div>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Control Flow</h2>
      <p><u><em>Control flow</em></u> determines which tasks in a process may execute in which order. A traditional card game illustrates this principle. If one turn involves (1) requesting cards and (2) placing a bet, then the requesting cards activity must be complete before placing a bet, and both activities must complete before the next player can have a turn. The current task has control, and when it completes, control is passed to the next task.</p>
      <p>(NB: Accountants frequently refer to &ldquo;controls&rdquo; or &ldquo;internal controls.&rdquo; These terms are unrelated to control flow. They are part of the Control section of accounting architecture.)</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Data Flow</h2>
      <p>The purpose of many process tasks, especially recording tasks familiar to accountants, is to create data. <u><em>Data flow</em></u> tracks data creation, use, and storage by identifying which task creates the data, which tasks use the data, and where the data is stored. A straightforward example would be a sample sales order process. The customer contacts the sales rep to place an order; the sales rep creates a sales order that the inventory warehouse uses to fill the order; the warehouse passes the sales order to the billing department, so that the billing department can create an invoice to send to the customer.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Modeling Standards</h2>
      <p>Sometimes, in order to quickly communicate processes, individuals may draft ad-hoc activity diagrams with arbitrary shapes, just as individuals or groups may invent words or phrases to communicate complex concepts. However, many activity diagrams adhere to specific frameworks with templates (i.e., predefined sets of shapes). These frameworks serve to make the diagrams more widely understood. Two well-known diagramming frameworks are:</p>
      <ul style="display: inline-block">
        <li>Data flow diagrams</li>
        <li>Flowcharts</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Data Flow Diagrams</h2>
      <div class="flex-row">
        <div class="flex-item" style="max-width: 55%">
          <p>Data flow diagrams (DFDs) are one of the simplest forms of diagrams. They use only three shapes, along with arrows to show flow. Two different groups introduced nearly identical templates for DFDs:</p>
          <p>(NB: This is an example of the multiple uses of &ldquo;process.&rdquo; The whole DFD describes a business process, and the process shape shows one task within the business process.)</p>
        </div>
        <div class="flex-item override"><img src="../images/dfd.png" alt="DFD Template"/></div>
      </div>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Sample DFD</h2>
      <div class="override"><img src="../images/sample-dfd.png" alt="Sample DFD"/></div>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Narrative</h2>
        <p>The vendor sends an invoice. The invoice is compared to the purchase order for discrepancies. If the invoice and the purchase order agree, the invoice is approved and added to the invoice file. A check is prepared from the data in the invoice file and sent to the vendor. The check stub is used to update the cash payments file, and the check stub is filed by vendor and date.</p>
        <p>(NB: These files may be either digital or physical. For example, the check stub file may be a physical file with printed check stubs, whereas the invoice file is likely a database table with the information from approved invoices.)</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>DFD Conventions</h2>
      <p>In addition to a set of prescribed shapes, diagramming frameworks may also stipulate drawing conventions. For example:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Flow of data and control (i.e., flowlines) is signified by arrows with arrowheads.</li>
        <li>Because DFDs have no data shapes other than data stores, the data transfered from step to step is displayed as a label next to the arrow between the two steps.</li>
        <li>Gane-Sarson flowlines only point vertically or horizontally with 90&deg; angles, but Yourdon flowlines can point in any direction and even curve.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Simplicity &ne; Readability</h2>
      <p>Data flow diagrams promote simplicity by restricting themselves to three shapes. Other diagramming frameworks with larger templates can result in cluttered diagrams, which reduces readability. However, simplicity will not always increase readability. For example, the lack of predetermined direction for DFDs conflicts with a preference to read from top to bottom and left to right. Additionally, DFDs have no mechanism for communicating accountability (i.e., who performs a task), which is important information for accountants and auditors. As a result, DFDs may be better for a high-level overview, instead of a detailed perspective.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Types of Flowcharts</h2>
      <p>Flowcharts are one of the oldest diagramming frameworks and, perhaps, also the most common. Although they are more complex than DFDs, they can provide more relevant information about a business process. The two primary types of flowcharts are:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><u><em>System flowcharts</em></u> show data and control flow through a system from origin through processing to final disposition.</li>
        <li><u><em>Program flowcharts</em></u> show logic and control flow in a program, usually a computer program.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>System flowcharts are for business processes. However, because of the current reliance on digital systems, program flowcharts can be a valuable tool for diagramming automated tasks.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Common Flowchart Shapes</h2>
      <div class="override"><img src="../images/flowchart.png" alt="Flowchart Shapes"/></div>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Sample Flowchart</h2>
        <div class="override"><img src="../images/sample-flowchart.png" alt="Sample Flowchart" style="max-height: 600px"/></div>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Narrative</h2>
      <p>The Warehouse agent reviews inventory levels and generates a purchase requisition for inventory. The Warehouse agent then files a copy of the purchase requisition and sends a copy to the Purchasing Department. The Purchasing Department generates a purchase order, files a copy of the purchase order with the purchase requisition, sends a copy of the purchase order to Inventory Control to file with Inventory Control's copy of the purchase requisition, and sends a copy of the purchase order to the Vendor.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Flowchart Conventions</h2>
      <p>Flowcharts have more shapes in their template than DFDs, and they also have more specific drawing conventions. Because of the high number of shapes in a flowchart, these conventions can significantly increase readability:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Flowcharts are read from top to bottom and left to right.</li>
        <li>Flow of data and control is signified by arrows with arrowheads.</li>
        <li>Flowlines should only point vertically or horizontally with 90&deg; angles. Arrows should also not cross. Connectors serve to link process steps when unbroken flowlines are not possible.</li>
        <li>For system flowcharts with multiple agents, flowcharts are subdivided into swimlanes (i.e., columns that signify which activities belong to which agent).</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Reading Flowcharts</h2>
      <p>Any communication tool serves a dual purpose of sending and receiving information. The same applies to diagrams, in the sense that one person can draw the diagram and another can read it. Although the ability to draw flowcharts may prove useful in certain situations, the primary reason for accountants to learn flowcharting is to be able to read and interpret flowcharts of processes and programs. The ability to read flowcharts creates efficiencies in understanding and evaluating processes, as well as weaknesses in those processes. This understanding allows accountants to audit processes and/or consult on process improvements. (Regulation may restrict the ability to combine consulting and audit activities.)</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Sales Process</h2>
      <div class="override"><img src="../images/sales-process.png" alt="Flowchart of Sales Process" style="max-height: 600px"/></div>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Narrative: Sales, Credit, and Warehouse</h2>
      <p>The Customer submits an order to the Sales department. The Sales agent prepares a sales order and a credit request. The Credit agent reviews a credit report generated from the customer file, the accounts receivable file, and external credit data and approves the order by marking order in the sales order file as approved and sending a credit approval to the Sales agent. The Sales agent notifies the Warehouse of the approved order. The Warehouse agent uses the data from the approved sales order generated from the sales order database to prepare goods for shipping. The Warehouse agent also updates the Shipment database with the contents of the shipment, which generates a packing slip (i.e., a list of goods in the shipment) to send with the goods to the Carrier.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Narrative: Billing and Accounting</h2>
      <p>Updating the shipment database also generates an inventory summary for Accounting and a billing request for Billing. The Billing agent updates the invoice database with the information from the billing request. Updating the invoice database generates an invoice, which the Billing agent sends to the Customer, and an A/R summary for Accounting. Once Accounting has an inventory summary and an A/R summary, the Accounting agent updates the inventory database to reflect current inventory levels and the A/R database. (This is an example of the difference between data and control flow. The inventory summary flows from the Warehouse to Accounting, but control in the process will not pass to Accounting until the Billing agent has updated the invoice database.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Cash Receipts Process</h2>
      <div class="override"><img src="../images/cash-receipts-process.png" alt="Flowchart of Cash Receipts Process" style="max-height: 600px"/></div>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Narrative</h2>
      <p>The Mailroom receives the mail, and the Mailroom agent opens the mail and separates customer checks from remittance advices, which is the portion of the invoice that the customer remits with the payment. (This is an example of a <u><em>turn-around document</em></u>. A turn-around document begins at one entity (e.g., seller), goes to a second (e.g., customer), and then returns to the first entity.) The check goes to the Cashier, and the remittance advice goes to Accounting. The Cashier prepares the bank deposit and updates the payment database, which generates a deposit slip for the bank. The Accounting agent compares the customer payment with the remittance advice and updates the accounts receivable database.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Purchase and Payments Processes</h2>
      <div class="override"><img src="../images/purchase-and-payments-processes.png" alt="Flowchart of Purchase and Payments Processes" style="max-height: 600px"/></div>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Narrative: Purchase Process</h2>
      <p>The inventory database generates a purchase requisition, when inventory falls below its reorder point. The Purchasing agent generates a purchase order and selects a vendor from the approved vendor database. The purchase order is sent to the Vendor, Receiving, Accounting, and Accounts Payable. When the goods arrive with a packing slip from the Vendor, the Receiving agent counts and inspects the goods, compares the goods to the packing slip and the purchase order and creates a receiving report for Accounting and Accounts Payable. The Accounting agent compares the receiving report with the purchase order and updates accounts payable and inventory.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Narrative: Payments Process</h2>
      <p>When Accounts Payable receives a Vendor invoice, the Accounts Payable agent compares the invoice to the purchase order and the receiving report and approves payment. The Accounts Payable agent then forwards the invoice and a payment voucher, which approves payment, to the Treasurer. The Treasurer prepares and signs a check and remittance advice and sends these to the Vendor. The Treasurer then sends the invoice and payment voucher to Accounting, and the Accounting agent updates accounts payable to reflect the payment and files the invoice.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Exceptions</h2>
      <p>The examples describe business processes without any errors. However, this is not a true, or at least complete, reflection of reality. In business, sometimes ordered goods are out of stock, payments are for the wrong amount, goods are damaged in transit, or invoices fail to match purchase orders. In these situations, business entities must include tasks in each business process to address errors and discrepancies. For example, if a vendor sends an incorrect invoice, the business must have a process for contacting the vendor to rectify the situation before approving payment.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>What, Not How</h2>
      <p>These flowcharts focus exclusively on <em>what</em> happens in a process, and not <em>how</em>. Each of the individual tasks in these processes is a black box, and the structure of the information system and how it stores the necessary data and generates the desired reports is completely opaque. The specific steps taken to perform each task will vary between business entities. The design of the information system that supports these business processes&mdash;the focus of accounting architecture&mdash;will also vary by compliance, business model, and risk goals, as indicated by the Environment section of the arch. One of these goals that has recently taken the business and IT world by storm is automation.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Automation</h2>
      <p>Automation is the use of digital systems to replace manual tasks. Computers and information systems exist to automate. Early computers automated complex mathematical calculations. More recent systems have begun to learn how to automate all sorts of tasks: understanding human speech and writing, driving, valuing stock portfolios, etc. With respect to business processes, computers have automated data flow by allowing systems to transfer information to end-users, instead of relying on paper-based ledgers and reports. As a result, some accounting tasks that existed before automation (e.g., the need to maintain separate journals, ledgers, and sub-ledgers with periodic reconciliation) have evolved (e.g., one database for all transactions with automatic grouping by account, as needed).</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>How Secure Is My Job?</h2>
      <p>Automation will continue to change the landscape of the accounting profession, and the expectation is that in the near future, many bookkeeping tasks and some accounting and auditing tasks will be &ldquo;outsourced&rdquo; to computers as computers become increasingly able to understand and apply accounting standards and evaluate transaction databases for errors and fraud. According to <a href="https://willrobotstakemyjob.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" aria-label="Website opens in new window">one website</a>, bookkeepers, accountants, and auditors are exposed to over 90% automation risk. Even if these numbers are overstated, this should serve as a strong indicator that adaptation and evolution of the accounting profession is necessary in order to remain relevant.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Why CFO and not CIO?</h2>
      <p>One dimension of evolution is the assimilation of responsibilities previously associated with other professions. Currently, the CFO is the C-suite executive associated with accountants. CIO (Chief Information Officer), CSO (Chief Security Officer) and CDO (Chief Data Officer) are generally associated with information-related professions. However, accounting is and should be an information-related profession, and especially accounting architects can and should have the skills necessary to serve as data, security, and information executives. An important first step in this evolution is the assimilation of all business information under the heading &ldquo;accounting information.&rdquo;</p>
    </section>

      <h2>Information Flows</h2>
      <p>This data flow diagram provides a high-level overview of business information flows that can all come under the umbrella of accounting information.</p>
      <img src="../images/dfd-cycles.png" alt="DFD of Business Information"/>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Big Data and Data Analytics</h2>
      <p>Big Data expands on the amount of available accounting information. Although the number of visits to a website or the content of social media posts following a television advertisement or the frequency of Google searches for a specific product may not seem like accounting information, these can all lead to better information for strategic decision making if measured and reported properly. For example, understanding social media sentiment or Google searches can increase the precision of sales forecasts; tracking website visits can give insight into advertising and marketing budgets; measuring the correlation between online and in-store purchases can explain the interplay between sales channels. Big Data is accounting information.</p>
