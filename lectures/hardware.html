			<h2>Accounting Architecture</h2>
			<div class="flex-row">
				<div class="flex-item override"><img src="../images/arch.png" alt="AA Arch" style="max-width: 300px"/></div>
				<div class="flex-item" style="max-width: 65%">
					<p>The Information section of the accounting architecture framework explains what a system should <em>do</em>. The Technology section explains what a system should <em>be</em>. Although the information life cycle can apply to both digital and non-digital information systems, the Technology section focuses on the components of a digital information system. The reason for this focus should be clear: enterprise-grade information systems are digital.</p>
				</div>
			</div>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h2>Technology Roadmap</h2>
			<p>The Technology section of the accounting architecture framework comprises four aspects of information technology:</p>
			<ol>
				<li><u><em>Hardware</em></u>: physical components of the information system</li>
				<li><u><em>Software</em></u>: operating systems, programming languages, and applications</li>
				<li><u><em>Storage</em></u>: data stores</li>
				<li><u><em>Services</em></u>: networking and cloud computing</li>
			</ol>
			<p>All four aspects are interdependent, and each plays a vital role in enterprise-grade information systems. Hardware is the most basic and foundational part of an information system. Without hardware, nothing else is possible, although some interesting exceptions to this rule exist...</p>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h2>Who Cares?</h2>
			<p>It may be easy for accountants to intuit the importance of the Compliance and Business Model blocks of the Environment section because these relate directly to traditional accounting tasks. The value of understanding the information life cycle may be somewhat less obvious but still related to the familiar accounting roles of recording transactions and reporting business information. On the other hand, the Technology section may seem irrelevant to accountants because information technology is the purview of a completely separate profession. However, in order to ensure that the information system fills its intended roles, accounting architects must understand what tools allow an information system to fill its intended roles. To use an analogy, it is insufficient to know how the puzzle should look, if the builder cannot identify the correct pieces.</p>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h2>What It's Made Of</h2>
			<p>An information system is an accumulation of different types of computing devices. Users interact with information systems via laptops, workstations (i.e., personal computers), mobiles devices, wearables, etc. Information systems also include back-end servers to make content available to users that is not stored on their personal computing devices. The specific roles of these hardware devices is the focus of the Services block of accounting architecture. Although these devices look different and serve different purposes, the hardware inside of them is actually quite similar. As a result, understanding the make-up of even one computing device in an information system can go a long way toward understanding the hardware make-up of an entire information system.</p>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h2>Learning by Doing</h2>
			<p>Understanding the components of a single computing device is a useful first step toward understanding the components of an information system. Pretending to build a computer is a useful method for learning the components of a computing device and discovering what each component does. Even though this method includes a discussion of some hardware components that are mostly irrelevant to accountants, after completing this walkthrough, a computer ceases to be a black box and instead becomes a collection of interconnected tools in the hands of an accounting architect.</p>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h2>What to Build</h2>
			<p>For the purpose of demonstrating the hardware components of a sample computing device, workstations and servers are excellent candidates for three reasons. First, the hardware make-up of both workstations and servers are essentially identical and simpler to understand that some other computing devices. Second, because these are much larger than mobile or wearable devices, the individual components are more easily recognized and studied. Third, the general hardware make-up of servers and workstations has not changed in decades, so many information systems include computers similar to what this walkthrough will demonstrate.</p>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h2>Ingredients List</h2>
			<p>Depending on its function, a server or workstation may not need all of these components, but a it often includes the following:</p>
			<ol style="display: inline-block; font-weight: bold">
				<li>Central Processing Unit (CPU)</li>
				<li>Motherboard</li>
				<li>Random-access Memory (RAM)</li>
				<li>Storage drive</li>
				<li>Case</li>
				<li>Graphics Processing Unit (GPU)</li>
				<li>Power Supply Unit (PSU)</li>
			</ol>
			<p>It is not necessary to build a computer in this order, but the components are interrelated, and this list places the more important components higher up.</p> 
		</section>

		<section>
			<h2>Central Processing Unit</h2>
			<div class="flex-row">
				<div class="flex-item" style="max-width: 70%">
					<p>The <em><u>central processing unit</u></em> (CPU) carries out the computer instructions by fetching data from memory, performing an operation on the data, and returning the result of the operation to memory. This is the brain of the computer, and the computer's ability to process data is primarily driven by how powerful the CPU is. No other hardware component can compensate for a CPU that provides insufficient processing power. Important considerations when choosing a CPU are <u><em>architecture</em></u> and <u><em>speed</em></u>.</p>

		</section>

		<section>
			<h2>Architecture</h2>
			<p>The manner in which the CPU interprets computer instructions depends on the <u><em>instruction set architecture</em></u> (ISA). The ISA is the set of operations the CPU can perform on the data it has fetched. Software that runs on one architecture is inherently incompatible (i.e., will not run) with any other. Since the inception of the CPU, manufacturers have offered many different architectures, but currently, two are the most prominent: x86 and ARM. x86 processors rely on <u><em>complex instruction set computing</em></u> (CISC) instruction set architecture, whereas ARM processors utilize the more limited <u><em>reduced instruction set computing</em></u> (RISC) instruction set architecture.</p>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h2>X86 and ARM</h2>
			<p>In 1978, Intel released the 8086 processor, which launched the x86 line of processors which Intel continues to offer as the most popular architecture in personal computers and many servers. Advanced Micro Devices is also well known for their x86-compatible lines of processors.</p>
			<p>Unlike Intel, SoftBank and its subsidiary ARM Holdings are not manufacturers. Instead, they license their intellectual property to other manufacturers, such as Broadcom, Qualcomm, Samsung, Freescale, etc. Because of the smaller instruction set, ARM processors require less electricity then x86 processors, which makes them the popular choice for mobile devices.</p>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h2>Word Length</h2>
			<p>Computer processing also depends on <u><em>word length</em></u> or the number of bits the CPU can process at once. The longer the word length, the more data the CPU can process at the same time. Most processors sold currently have 64-bit word length. The 64-bit architecture is frequently labeled by the abbreviation x64 or x86_64 to signify its x86 ISA or ARM64 to signify its ARM ISA. Until recently, the most common processor word length was 32 bits, and despite the transition to 64-bit processors, surprisingly, many software applications continue to be written for 32-bit processors. The transition to 64-bit processors has both increased processing power and overcome multiple limitations faced by 32-bit processors.</p>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h2>Limitations</h2>
			<p>One of the limitations of 32-bit processors is that they only support 3.2 gigabytes of <u><em>random-access memory</em></u> (RAM). Prior to the introduction of 64-bit processors, manufacturers would add <u><em>physical address extension</em></u> to 32-bit processors that would remove the 3.2 GB cap. 64-bit processors, on the other hand, can accommodate up to 16 exabytes of memory.</p>
			<p>Compatibility is another limitation. Just as software written for one ISA is incompatible with another, software written for one word length is incompatible with another. Software written for x86_64 or ARM64 will not run on their 32-bit counterparts. Fortunately, with some help, software written for x86 or ARM can run on their 64-bit counterparts.</p>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h2>Real-world Problem</h2>
			<p>Unfortunately, the limitations of 32-bit word length extend beyond processing speed and memory caps. Before the year 2000, in order to conserve data storage, software applications relied on two-digit years. As a result, it was not clear how computers would interpret 00 on January 1, 2000. This was known at the Y2K bug. The Y2K38 bug is similar. 32-bit applications count time in seconds starting on January 1, 1970, and will not be able to report time past 03:14:08 on January 19, 2038. A transition to 64-bit timestamps is necessary to overcome this limitation.</p>

		</section>

		<section>
			<h2>How Fast?</h2>
			<p>Both word length and instruction set affect the efficiency and speed of a processor, but the common measures of processor speed are <u><em>clock speed</em></u> and <u><em>instructions per second</em></u> or <u><em>floating-point operations per second</em></u> (FLOPS). The most familiar of these is clock speed or the number of cycles per second, which is calculated in Hertz. This is the metric used in computer and CPU advertisements. A cycle is the period of time in which the processor can execute an instruction. Because processors may be able to execute more than one instruction per cycle, a more useful measure of performance may be instructions per second which is the product of clock speed and instructions per cycle.</p>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h2>Multi-core Processors</h2>
			<p>CPU clock speeds have increased dramatically in the last three decades. However, it is not possible to increase clock speed forever. Moore's Law predicts that processor performance would double every 18 months, but it would not be possible to keep up with this prediction by increasing the power of a single processor. Instead, manufacturers add additional CPUs to one computer or additional cores to a single CPU to improve performance with <u><em>parallel processing</em></u>. Current CPUs can have as many as ten or more cores. The theoretical upper bound of the FLOPS of a multi-core processor is the FLOPS of a single core multiplied by the number of cores, but realized performance is always less because of both hardware and software constraints.</p>

			<h2>Motherboard</h2>

				<div class="override"><img src="../images/motherboard.png" alt="Motherboard" style="max-height: 600px"/></div>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h2>Keeping It All Together</h2>
				<p>The second component to select is the <u><em>motherboard</em></u>. The motherboard is a circuit board that holds the system components and allows communication between them. Some motherboards also include integrated audio, video, and network capabilities. The size and shape of the computer case and the type of <u><em>CPU socket</em></u> restrict the type of motherboard. Different CPUs fit into different sockets.</p>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h2>Never Forget</h2>
			<p>In addition to a CPU, each computer requires <u><em>random-access memory</em></u> (RAM). RAM, frequently simply referred to as memory, is a type of volatile computer storage&mdash;volatile means that it requires electricity to store data&mdash;that allows for fast retrieval of data. The greater the amount of memory, the faster the computer can operate because it can store more data in this fast-retrieval repository. Currently, RAM takes on the form of double data rate synchronous dynamic random-access memory (DDR SDRAM). The motherboard constrains RAM <u><em>size</em></u>, <u><em>speed</em></u>, and <u><em>capacity</em></u>.</p>

		</section>

		<section>
			<h2>Keeping Up with the Jones</h2>
			<p>Speed is important for RAM, just as it is for a CPU. This is a list of common transfer speeds of the third generation of DDR SDRAM.</p>
			<img src="../images/ddr3.png" alt="DDR3" style="max-height: 300px"/>
			<p>Although RAM allows for fast data retrieval, it cannot supply data to the CPU as fast as the CPU can process it, so RAM always creates a bottleneck for computer processing.</p>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h2>Multiplicity</h2>
			<p>An individual stick of memory comes in two sizes: dual in-line memory module (DIMM) or small outline dual in-line memory module (SO-DIMM). The former is generally for workstations and servers, and the latter is for notebooks, smaller form-factor personal computers, and network hardware. The motherboard's memory slots determine maximum memory capacity and speed. DIMMs currently have common capacities of 2GB, 4GB, 8GB and 16GB, and motherboards generally have two or four slots. It is not necessary to fill all slots, nor is it necessary for all DIMMs to have the same capacity or speed. However, the computer will function at the speed of the slowest DIMM.</p>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h2>Hard &ne; Solid</h2>
			<p>In addition to volatile storage, a computer needs non-volatile storage. Customarily, this takes the form or either <u><em>hard disk drives</em></u> (HDD) or <u><em>solid-state drives</em></u> (SSD). Hard drives are mechanical and rely on multiple magnetized spinning disks to read and write data. Solid-state drives generally use NAND flash memory to read and write data more quickly. The speed with which the motherboard can access data from the drive is determined by the speed of the <u><em>Serial AT Attachment</em></u> (SATA) connection to the drive calculated in gigabits per second.</p>

		</section>

		<section>
			<h2>Too Hot</h2>
			<p>Additionally, because the CPU generates heat, it is necessary to cool it with either a fan or a heatsink or a combination of the two.</p>

		<section>
			<h2>Swapping</h2>
			<p>Historically, a computer could not handle consumption of all available memory because the CPU would not be able to find the next instruction. Virtual memory overcame this problem by reserving a portion of the hard drive as secondary memory, called <u><em>swap space</em></u>. If most of the physical memory was reserved, the operating system would move some of the data stored in physical memory to the swap space to free up physical memory. The process of moving data from main memory to secondary memory is called <u><em>paging</em></u>. Although it allows a computer to continue functioning, paging is very slow because accessing data from drives is slower than access data from RAM, and the computer can become unresponsive as a result.</p>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h2>Where To Begin?</h2>
			<p>Each computer part influences the possible specifications of the other parts, so it is difficult to determine where to start. We will assume that the first consideration is available space. The component that determines the size of the computer is the <u><em>case</em></u>. Several sizes exist, and beyond aesthetics, the size determines the type of <u><em>motherboard</em></u>, access to <u><em>expansion slots</em></u>, and <u><em>rackability</em></u> (i.e., the ability to store the computer in a server rack).</p>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h2>Server Racks</h2>
			<p>Despite their fancy moniker and appearance, nothing is special about server racks. They are simply special closets for computers that use a certain type of case. Racks are convenient for organizing these computers and may include lockable doors for added physical security. (We will discuss the role of physical security with the Control section of the course.)</p>
			<img src="../images/racks.jpg" alt="Server Rack" style="max-height: 300px"/>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h2>Seeing is Believing</h2>
			<p>Although not necessary, many computers also contain a video card. These cards contain their own processing unit, called a graphical processing unit (GPU), their own fan or heatsink, and their own memory (GDDR or SGRAM). These cards can draw graphical objects more quickly than a CPU. Many current computers require no video card because newer processors (e.g. i3 Intel processors) have both CPU cores and integrated GPU cores. Graphics cards contain ports for connecting monitors, and motherboards also contain these ports for use with CPU-integrated graphics. Servers, which generally use no graphical environment, need no graphics capabilities beyond what the CPU can provide.</p>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h2>GPU Computing</h2>
			<p>Although servers generally need no GPU for rendering graphics, the benefits of GPUs extend beyond the traditional uses for desktop graphics and 3D gaming. Because graphics cards generally have many GPU cores (100+), whereas CPUs frequently have between 2 and 8 cores, GPUs are useful for repeatedly performing simple operations. The GPU cores cannot perform many of the complex tasks that CPUs can handle, but their ability to share simple tasks across a plethora of cores allows them to perform some tasks more efficiently than their CPU counterparts. This is particularly useful for Big Data analytics, which involves repetitious processing of bits of data.</p>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h2>Powering It All</h2>
			<div class="flex-row">
				<!--License: CC-BY-SA 3.0 Attribution: Danrok-->
				<div class="flex-item"><img src="../images/psu.jpg" alt="Power Supply" style="max-height: 150px"/></div>
				<div class="flex-item" style="max-width: 75%">
					<p>The final requisite component is the <u><em>power supply unit</em></u> (PSU), which gives power directly to storage drives and indirectly to the CPU, RAM, and other components through the motherboard. The computer case determines the maximum supported PSU size, but the more important consideration is power needed. It is difficult to determine exactly how much power will be necessary for a specific setup, but for a standard workstation or server 600 watts can suffice.</p>
				</div>
			</div>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h2>How Would This Be Different for Mobile Devices?</h2>
			<p>Although mobile devices, such as smartphones and tablets, include the same set of components, the configuration looks different to conserve on space and energy. For example, instead of including a CPU, DIMMs of memory, and a graphics card, these devices have a <u><em>System on a Chip</em></u> (SoC), in which CPU cores, memory, GPU cores, and sometimes cell radios, are combined into a single chip. Many, though not all, of these use ARM processors because they further reduce energy consumption and generate less heat. However, Intel has fervently reduced the gap between x86 and ARM processors in an attempt to become more attractive to manufacturers of mobile devices.</p>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h2>SoC is for SBC</h2>
			<p>One common use for System on a Chip is Single Board Computers (SBCs). SBCs have a motherboard that differs from those found in workstations and servers. SBC boards have all components: CPU, GPU, RAM, etc., soldered onto the board. These take less space and use less energy than their larger counterparts. Although tablets and smartphones almost certainly use SBCs, the most well-known example of an SBC is the Raspberry Pi.</p>

		</section>

		<section>
			<h2>Accounting Tie-in</h2>
			<p>It goes without saying that accountants could not function without computer hardware. Historically, invoices, customer orders, job tickets, time cards, etc., have been paper documents, and accounting journals and ledgers were literal journals and ledgers. Even if we ignore the additional data collection, analysis, and reporting roles that accountants must assume in the current technological environment, the conversion of accounting documents to accounting data, even in small businesses, makes computer hardware indispensable. Understanding the role each hardware component plays allows accounting architects to understand how to meet, efficiently and effectively, the performance needs of the users of the information system.</p>
