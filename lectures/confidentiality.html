			<h3>Accounting Architecture</h3>

				<div class="flex-item" style="max-width: 65%">
					<p>Confidentiality is the final Control block in the accounting architecture arch. It comprises more than one pillar of the Trust Services Framework, but it has a single overarching goal: to prevent unauthorized access to secret information. It is not an accident that this sounds similar to the role of access controls because Confidentiality and Security are closely related.</p>

			<h3>Trust Services Framework</h3>
			<div class="flex-row">
				<div class="flex-item override"><img src="../images/trust-services.png" alt="Trust Services Framework" style="max-width: 300px"/></div>
				<div class="flex-item" style="max-width: 70%">
					<p>The two pillars in the Trust Services Framework that the Confidentiality block comprises are Confidentiality and Privacy. The AICPA explains the difference between these two terms. &ldquo;Confidentiality is distinguished from privacy in that privacy deals with personal information whereas, confidentiality refers to a broader range of information that is not restricted to personal information.&rdquo; From this explanation it is clear that the same tools protect privacy and confidentiality.</p>

			<h3>Security and Confidentiality</h3>
			<div class="flex-row">
				<div class="flex-item" style="max-width: 70%">
					<p>As it does with the other pillars of the Trust Services Framework, Security plays a role in promoting confidentiality. In fact, a primary focus of Security (i.e., access controls) is to keep data confidential. Because of the similarity between the concepts of Security and Confidentiality, many tools designed to preserve confidentiality are commonly referred to as security tools. The fundamental difference between these two is the precise methods of preventing unauthorized access.</p>

			<h3>Confidentiality and Compliance</h3>
			<div class="flex-row">
				<div class="flex-item" style="max-width: 65%">
					<p>Especially as it pertains to the &ldquo;privacy&rdquo; side, Compliance is particularly applicable to the Confidentiality block of the Architecture. Much of the concept of compliance is familiar to accountants because so much of the profession revolves around regulatory compliance (e.g., GAAP, IFRS, IRC). However, compliance also includes the laws and private contracts that dictate the protection of trade secrets, customer data, intellectual property, etc.</p>

			<h3>Confidentiality</h3>
			<blockquote>Information designated as confidential is protected as committed or agreed.</blockquote>
			<p>Three tools commonly serve to keep information secret:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><u><i>Rights management</i></u> avoids unlicensed use of intellectual property.</li>
				<li><u><i>Intermediation</i></u> anonymizes communication.</li>
				<li><u><i>Encryption</i></u> prevents reading sensitive content, especially in transit.</li>
			</ul>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h3>Rights Management</h3>
			<p>Intellectual property licenses dictate approved use of licensed content. Maintenance of rights metadata prevents authorized access and ensures prompt deletion of content with expired licenses. As a result, rights management is a required compliance activity when using licensed content. This practice applies not only to proprietary content, but also to open source. Because open source licenses are licenses, rights management is necessary to comply with the license requirements. This frequently involves correct attribution (i.e., including the name of the original creator with the product) and reciprocation (i.e., using a license that is compatible with the original license for internal modifications).</p>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h3>Intermediation</h3>
			<p>The concept of intermediation is not unique to digital communication. Any time that one party interacts with another via a middleman, intermediation has occurred. This is not a perfect analogy because the purpose of these middlemen is not always to anonymize interactions. For example, information intermediaries, such as analysts, communicate information regarding firm performance to investors; financial intermediaries funnel funds from one group to another. In the case of analysts, anonymity is not an issue, and for financial intermediation, only sometimes is the intent to preserve anonymity, frequently it is simply for convenience.</p>
		</section>
		
		<section>
			<h3>Review of the WAN</h3>
			<p>In order to access Internet (i.e., WAN) resources, a device must have a public IP address. Although this address may differ from the IP address that a computer reports for itself, it is the address that the device uses to communicate on the WAN. Similar to the premise of caller ID, when a computer accesses an Internet resource (e.g., a Web site), the server that hosts that resource records the public IP address the client computer. This record exposes some aspects of the identity of the user because the public IP can be traced to the geographical location of the client.</p>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h3>Proxy Servers</h3>
			<p><u><i>Proxy servers</i></u> serve as intermediaries between a user and an Web server to change the client's public IP address. The client selects and connects to a proxy server, and while connected, the proxy server forwards all Internet requests from the client to the Web server and content from the Web server to the client. The Web server records the IP address of the proxy server, instead of the client. Attempts to identify the location of the client would prove fruitless, as the proxy server may be in a different part of the world as the actual client.</p>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h3>Why Hide?</h3>
			<p>Hiding the client's public IP address has a number of advantages. On the less nefarious side of things, the user can access resources that are restricted to a particular country. For example, a US IP address is necessary in order to stream the Netflix content that Americans expect to find. Using a US-based proxy server will provide a client outside the US with a US IP address. On the more nefarious side of things, proxy servers can allow perpetrators of illicit activities (e.g., hacking or the sale or purchase of contraband) to evade detection. Corporations also often use them to anonymize traffic from the devices inside their LANs.</p>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h3>Bring to Light</h3>
			<p>Corporations also use proxy servers for two other reasons. First, if users inside a corporate LAN need to access the same WAN resources (e.g., a Web site) frequently, the proxy server can create a cache (i.e., a temporary copy) of that resource so that the clients can access it more quickly. Second, although a proxy server can hide the IP address of the client from the Internet server, the proxy server itself records the IP address of the client, as well as the traffic to and from the client. This provides the corporation an easy method to track which Web sites their employees have accessed.</p>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h3>Proxy Servers and Firewalls</h3>
			<p>A firm can use a firewall to keep remote users away from a server, but they can also use a firewall to keep LAN users from accessing remote servers. For example, if a university wanted to prevent its employees from accessing social media sites, a firewall could block access to these sites from university computers. Proxy servers can circumvent these restrictions because to the university's firewall the client only accessed a proxy server, not a social media site.</p>

		<section>
			<h3>VPN</h3>
			<p><u><i>Virtual private networks</i></u> are similar to proxy servers in that they serve as an intermediary between a client and Internet servers. However, VPN servers have a particular advantage over proxy servers, and that is that VPN servers encrypt the communication with the client. This prevents eavesdropping by unauthorized third parties. VPN is a popular tool for teleworking. If the VPN server is part of an organization's LAN, then a client connecting to the VPN from the WAN can access LAN resources, such as private clouds, as if that client were inside the LAN, hence the name &ldquo;virtual private network&rdquo; because it simulates being connected to a private network. VPN servers are also popular for secure use of public WiFi networks (e.g., coffee shops).</p>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h3>Eavesdropping</h3>
			<p>Unauthorized eavesdropping on network communication is a problem because the standard for network communication is plain text. A fitting analogy would be tapping a phone line. It is possible to eavesdrop on a phone call because it transmits human-interpretable speech. The same applies to intercepting written communication. Plain text is the human-readable form of digital data. Just as with phone calls and letters, it is usually infeasible to protect network messages while in transit from being intercepted. Access controls are not useful to prevent unauthorized access to communication.</p>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h3>Encryption</h3>
			<p>Since restricting access to data messages in transit is not feasible, the only option is to render a message unreadable if intercepted. <u><i>Encryption</i></u> uses a key to convert plain text into cipher text, which is unreadable by humans and computers. The key, sometimes referred to as a cipher, is a string of characters and an algorithm that determines a transformation of plain text to obtain cipher text. Although enterprise-grade data encryption keys rely on complicated mathematics, the principles are no different from those used to create a cipher text by shifting the letters in a message by one (i.e., a becomes b, b becomes c, etc.).</p>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h3>Decryption</h3>
			<p><u><i>Decryption</i></u> involves the opposite process of encryption. A decryption key uses a string of characters and an algorithm to convert cipher text back into plain text. In order to decrypt a message that the sender has encrypted, the recipient must have the decryption key. Although it may be possible to guess the decryption algorithm for simpler methods, such as shifting letters by one, the mathematics involved in popular encryption models (e.g., AES) are complex enough that calculating (i.e., guessing) a decryption key would take a computer billions of years.</p>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h3>Two Forms of Encryption</h3>
			<p>Encryption keys can either be symmetric or asymmetric. In symmetric, or private key, encryption, the encryption and decryption keys are the same, and both the sender and the recipient must have the same key. In asymmetric, or public key, encryption, the key to encrypt the data is publicly distributed and a paired private key is used for decryption. Public key encryption is secure so long as users keep their own private keys secret because, although users share their encryption keys, it is not feasible to infer the private decryption key from the public encryption key.</p>

			<h3>Public Key Cryptography</h3>

		</section>

		<section>
			<h3>Oversharing</h3>
			<p>Although the concept of public and private keys can be confusing, email addresses provide a suitable analogy that explains the concept in an accessible manner. A public key is like an email address. In order to receive email, the recipient must distribute the address. This is a secure behavior because the email address is not sufficient to read received emails. Viewing emails requires an additional input: a password which the owner of the account keeps secret and which is not inferable from the email address. Similarly, a public key allows a sender to specify a recipient, so the public key must be publicly available. A private key, like a password, remains secret in order to restrict access to decrypted messages.</p>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h3>Cryptographic Hash</h3>
			<p>Even though cipher text is not human- or computer-readable, it can still provide useful information even when decryption is not possible. In fact, some encryption protocols (e.g., MD5) are designed to convert data into a short cipher text that cannot be decrypted. This short cipher text is called a <u><i>cryptographic hash</i></u> or a checksum. The purpose of a hash is not to protect a message in transit but rather to verify the integrity of the data. Because hash encryption protocols use a single key that is common to all users of the protocol, any attempt to create a hash of the same content will result in the same hash. However, even a slight modification to the data will result in a different hash.</p>
		</section>
		
		<section>
			<h3>Tamper-proof</h3>
			<div class="flex-row">
				<div class="flex-item" style="max-width: 65%">
					<p>Calculating a hash after receiving a file and comparing it to a hash that the sender provides will reveal whether the file has been modified. For example, if a hacker gains access to and adds a virus to an online file, then users who download and launch the file can become infected. If the creator of the file provided a hash of the original file and users calculated a hash of the downloaded file, they would learn that the file had become corrupted and delete it.</p>
				</div>
				<div class="flex-item override"><img src="../images/checksum.png" alt="Checksum"/></div>
			</div>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h3>Digital Signature</h3>
			<div class="flex-row">
				<div class="flex-item" style="max-width: 70%">
					<p>Another benefit of encrypted cipher text is its ability to identify the sender. Because a public-private key pair is unique to a single user, it turns out that these keys can verify the senders identity by allowing the sender to attach a <u><i>digital signature</i></u> to the message. (This is different from the digital signature that cardholders create after swiping a credit card.) A sender creates a cryptographic digital signature by (1) creating a hash of the message and (2) encrypting the hash with the sender's private key.</p>
				</div>
				<div class="flex-item"><img src="../images/signing.png" alt="Digital Signature" style="max-width: 300px"/></div>

			<h3>Verify the Signature</h3>
			<div class="flex-row">
				<div class="flex-item"><img src="../images/signature-verification.png" alt="Verify the Signature" style="max-width: 300px"/></div>
				<div class="flex-item" style="max-width: 70%">
					<p>The sender then transmits the message and the signature to the recipient. The recipient (1) creates a hash of the message, (2) decrypts the signature using the sender's public key and (3) compares the hash with the decrypted signature. If they are equal, then the sender's identity is confirmed <em>and</em> the message has not been modified in transit. If they are different, then either the message has been modified or the sender is not who he claims to be.</p>

			<h3>HTTPS and SFTP</h3>
			<p>Although it is possible to use a computer to create keys, hashes, cipher text, and signatures manually, these processes frequently occur transparently for the end user. For example, when a Web site relies on <u><i>Secure Sockets Layer</i></u> (SSL) or <u><i>Transport Layer Security</i></u> (TLS) to establish encrypted communication with a client-side browser, the end-user is completely unaware of the transmission of keys. Sometimes, the only salient evidence of the encryption is the &ldquo;HTTPS&rdquo; schema with the URL. Just as the HTTP schema has a secure alternative (HTTPS), the FTP schema also has a secure alternative (SFTP). SFTP uses similar protocols for encrypted communication with a file server.</p>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h3>Secure Shell</h3>
			<p>VPN provides encrypted access to any number of WAN and LAN resources and is frequently used to provide teleworkers access to corporate information system components. Another popular tool for encrypted communication with remote computers is <u><i>Secure Shell</i></u> (SSH). As the name implies, SSH provides access to a text-based shell on a remote computer. This is comparable to using the terminal on a Unix-like operating system, except that the commands are run against a remote computer, instead of the local machine. This is the current standard for accessing the command line of another computer. SSH is commonly considered the secure alternative to telnet, which historically was the standard for communication between two computers.</p>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h3>Stationary</h3>
			<p>Many, and perhaps most, examples of digital encryption address network communication, but this is not the only valuable context. Encryption can also serve to secure stored data. One of the reasons why unauthorized physical access is dangerous is that although an unauthorized user cannot log in to a workstation, that same user can steal the hard drive and connect it to another device in order to read confidential data. Storage volume encryption can alleviate this concern by encrypting all content on a drive. An authorized user can enter a password while booting the computer in order to decrypt the volume. Once the volume is decrypted, it functions as an ordinary storage volume until the user shuts down the computer.</p>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h3>Cryptocurrency</h3>
			<p>Interestingly, one use of public key cryptography is cryptocurrency, of which Bitcoin is the most well-known variant. Each Bitcoin transaction (i.e., payment) is digitally signed by the private key of the payer to prove ownership of the coins, and each payment identifies its payee by the payee's public key. This use of keys creates a system that allows for complete anonymity because no method currently exists to identify the real-world identity of a payee by public key.</p>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h3>Accounting Tie-in</h3>
			<p>Businesses always care about keeping data confidential, and regulations require that employee, patient, and customer data remain private. Even in the absence of these regulations, media coverage of past data breaches demonstrates the harrowing effects of the leakage of confidential data. Internal and external auditors care about the implementation of proper protocols to secure Web pages, customer profile and payment sites, and off-site telework (e.g., company-issued mobile devices). Tax accountants care about properly secured communication for receiving and filing tax documents. A clear understanding of the proper tools enables accountants to promote systems that satisfy regulatory compliance, client expectations, and business needs.</p>
