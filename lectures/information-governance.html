					<p>This is the final accounting architecture lecture. The principles of information governance are not part of the arch of this framework because the arch depicts the design of the system, whereas information governance is the implementation of these principles. Despite its absence from this diagram, information governance is absolutely part of accounting architecture.</p>

			<h3>What are Accountants?</h3>
			<p>An understanding of information governance and the role that accountants play in it begins with a clear understanding of what accountants are. Much of this is a review of the initial discussion of accounting architecture, but now that the arch is familiar to you, it is useful to return to the beginning to understand what to do with it. A fundamental tenet of accounting architecture is that accountants are information custodians.</p>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h3>Accountants' ILC</h3>
			<p>Introductory accounting textbooks state that accountants measure and report on economic events. That means so much more than contriving journal entries. How can the accountant observe the economic event? What is the source of the data that the accountant uses to measure the event? How can the accountant convert that data into a report? The information life cycle, or Big Data life cycle as the case may be, <em>is</em> the answer to these questions. How the accountant acquires the data for measurement is the Creation phase; how the accountant converts the data to a report is the Use phase. The Maintenance phase is more behind-the-scenes but no less important.</p>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h3>Information Era</h3>
			<p>These questions address <em>how</em> accountants measure and report, but in order to fully grasp the implications of the role of information custodian, <em>what</em> accountants should measure and report on is of equal importance. What is an economic event? The answer to this question changes by firm and over time, but in the current landscape of the Information Era, an economic event is any occurrence that generates data that is useful to strategic planning. That is clearly a broad definition, but in the Information Era, this data creates wealth if used properly. A wealth-creating event <em>is</em> an economic event, even if traditional financial and management accounting rules and formulae cannot quantify it.</p>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h3>All by Myself</h3>
			<p>Having established how and what accountants should measure and report, the next question addresses whose responsibility it is to design a system that enables the accountants' role because it is certainly true that an information system is necessary. An obvious answer to this question is that an expert in both information technology and accounting should design the system because such a designer would know the informational needs of stakeholders (i.e., understand how to measure and report on economic events) and how to design and maintain an enterprise-grade, technology-based information system. Unfortunately, neither IT specialists nor accountants are experts in both.</p>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h3>Collaboration</h3>
			<p>Collaboration between IT specialists and accountants is the only solution. More generally, the collaboration must involve IT and business specialists, but the other fundamental tenet of accounting architecture is that accountants are the most valuable business specialists for this role because of their extensive knowledge of measurement and reporting. IT specialists bring IT knowledge and accountants bring business knowledge. This is similar to DevOps. In DevOps, IT specialists who deploy software collaborate with developers who write software. The goal of DevOps is to create a viable system. The same applies in this setting, but the parties and the roles differ somewhat. The name for this collaboration is business-led IT, but with accountants, accounting-led IT would be more appropriate.</p>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h3>Common Ground</h3>
			<p>Collaboration requires two things: independent knowledge and common knowledge. The independent knowledge allows both parties to contribute to the knowledge base. In the absence of independent knowledge, one party is superfluous. Because accountants and IT specialists have independent knowledge, they satisfy the first necessary condition. Common knowledge allows the parties to communicate with one another. Everyday communication is a simple example of this principle. If two individuals speak different languages, then they cannot communicate with one another. Analogously, without common knowledge, neither collaborating party can share independent knowledge.</p>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h3>Crossing the Bridge</h3>
			<p>In order for accountants and IT specialists to collaborate, their disciplines must move closer together until they partially overlap. However, accountants cannot rely on IT specialists to bridge the gap between the two disciplines for two reasons. First, no profession should be base its ability to progress solely on the efforts of another profession. Such inactivity will eventually lead to a lack of independent knowledge, as well, which would result in the obsolescence of accountants. Second, it is more difficult for IT specialists to learn the intricacies of accounting regulation than it is for an accountant to learn IT. A member of Deloitte internal audit reinforced this assertion by stating, &ldquo;We prefer to teach accountants IT, than to teach IT students double-entry accounting.&rdquo;</p>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h3>What to Learn</h3>
			<p>Accountants need an addition to their core competencies in order to transition from no common knowledge with IT specialists to some common knowledge. Accounting architecture, as blueprint for the design of an information system, provides a base understanding of the function and components of that system. Accountants who are familiar with accounting architecture can communicate and collaborate with IT specialists because they have common ground. Furthermore, because the accountants bring superior knowledge of the informational needs of stakeholders to the table, it is appropriate to identify the accountants as the leaders in this collaboration (i.e., accounting-led IT, not IT-led accounting).</p>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h3>Big Picture</h3>
			<p><u><em>Information governance</em></u> is the set of activities and technologies that organizations employ to maximize the value of their information while minimizing associated risks and costs. Accounting architecture is an implementation of information governance because it designates the role of accountants, technologies, and controls to maximize value of information and minimize risk. This definition of information governance reinforces the importance of accountants and accounting-led IT because organizations must combine business and IT expertise in order to achieve the goals of value maximization and risk minimization.</p>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h3>Additional Help</h3>
			<p>The benefit of accounting architecture to information governance is in the collaboration between accountants and IT. However, despite the relevant expertise of these two parties, another collaborator is also useful: legal. Legal specialists have expertise in regulatory and contract compliance, rights management, and privacy and confidentiality. This expertise addresses risk minimization, which is no less important than value maximization. Combined as maintainers of the information system, accounting, IT, and legal can protect the interests of the consumers of the information system: internal decision makers, regulatory bodies, and external stakeholders.</p>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h3>Final Tie-in</h3>
			<p>Accounting is far more than financial reporting. Accounting is information stewardship. Every business function consumes information. The information system can only provide that information if it is properly designed. IT specialists have too little business knowledge to know what to have the information system measure and report. Accountants who understand accounting architecture can collaborate with and lead IT specialists in the design of a useful information system. Equipped with this knowledge, accountants can become accounting architects.</p>
