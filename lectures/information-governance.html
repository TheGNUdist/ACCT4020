					<p>This is the final accounting architecture lecture. The principles of information governance are not part of the arch of this framework because the arch depicts the design of the system, whereas information governance is the implementation of these principles. Despite its absence from this diagram, information governance is absolutely part of accounting architecture.</p>

			<h3>What are Accountants?</h3>
			<p>An understanding of information governance and the role that accountants play in it begins with a clear understanding of what accountants are. Much of this is a review of the initial discussion of accounting architecture, but now that the arch is familiar to you, it is useful to return to the beginning to understand what to do with it. A fundamental tenet of accounting architecture is that accountants are information custodians.</p>

			<h3>Accountants' ILC</h3>
			<p>Introductory accounting textbooks state that accountants measure and report on economic events. That means so much more than contriving journal entries. How can the accountant observe the economic event? What is the source of the data that the accountant uses to measure the event? How can the accountant convert that data into a report? The information life cycle, or Big Data life cycle as the case may be, <em>is</em> the answer to these questions. How the accountant acquires the data for measurement is the Creation phase; how the accountant converts the data to a report is the Use phase. The Maintenance phase is more behind-the-scenes but no less important.</p>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h3>Information Era</h3>
			<p>These questions address <em>how</em> accountants measure and report, but in order to fully grasp the implications of the role of information custodian, <em>what</em> accountants should measure and report on is of equal importance. What is an economic event? The answer to this question changes by firm and over time, but in the current landscape of the Information Era, an economic event is any occurrence that generates data that is useful to strategic planning. That is clearly a broad definition, but in the Information Era, this data creates wealth if used properly. A wealth-creating event <em>is</em> an economic event, even if traditional financial and management accounting rules and formulae cannot quantify it.</p>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h3>All by Myself</h3>
			<p>Having established how and what accountants should measure and report, the next question addresses whose responsibility it is to design a system that enables the accountants' role because it is certainly true that an information system is necessary. An obvious answer to this question is that an expert in both information technology and accounting should design the system because such a designer would know the informational needs of stakeholders (i.e., understand how to measure and report on economic events) and how to design and maintain an enterprise-grade, technology-based information system. Unfortunately, neither IT specialists nor accountants are experts in both.</p>

		<section>
			<h3>Collaboration</h3>
			<p>Collaboration between IT specialists and accountants is the only solution. More generally, the collaboration must involve IT and business specialists, but the other fundamental tenet of accounting architecture is that accountants are the most valuable business specialists for this role because of their extensive knowledge of measurement and reporting. IT specialists bring IT knowledge and accountants bring business knowledge. This is similar to DevOps. In DevOps, IT specialists who deploy software collaborate with developers who write software. The goal of DevOps is to create a viable system. The same applies in this setting, but the parties and the roles differ somewhat. The name for this collaboration is business-led IT, but with accountants, accounting-led IT would be more appropriate.</p>
