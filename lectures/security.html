			<h3>Accounting Architecture</h3>
			<div class="flex-row">
				<div class="flex-item override"><img src="../images/Arch5Color.png" alt="AA Arch" style="max-width: 300px"/></div>
				<div class="flex-item" style="max-width: 65%">
					<p>Information is the keystone of any information system, and Technology is the set of tools necessary to implement that system. Control, however, is a choice. A system can function without proper controls. However, a system without proper controls exposes internal and external stakeholders to risks. The different blocks in the Control section represent different control objectives.</p>
				</div>
			</div>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h3>External Stakeholders</h3>
			<p>Accounting regulations are often for the purpose of protecting external stakeholders. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles and Generally Accepted Auditing Standards exist to protect external stakeholders from misinformation. <u><em>Sarbanes-Oxley</em></u> (SOX) requires firms to implement internal controls over financial reporting to prevent material misstatements. Additionally, with respect to information systems, business contracts work to prevent breaches of privacy, data loss, and system unavailability. As a result, compliance (one of the blocks in the foundation of the arch) often requires the implementation of controls, regardless of whether the system could function without them.</p>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h3>SOX</h3>
			<p>In response to the wide-spread calamities associated with the more extensive accounting frauds of the late 90's and early 2000's, Congress passed the Sarbanes-Oxley act of 2002 to introduce additional compliance requirements for firms and auditors in order to protect shareholders from accounting errors and fraud. SOX sections 302 and 404 require public firms to implement internal controls and to include an assessment of those internal controls in the annual audit.</p>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h3>Internal Stakeholders</h3>
			<p>Although regulations and contracts are less often designed to protect internal stakeholders, managers and other decision makers within the firm also benefit from controls. Controls reduce the likelihood of misinformation, which would lead to incorrect strategic decisions, and they protect the confidentiality of trade secrets. Because internal stakeholders are the biggest &ldquo;customer&rdquo; of the information system, protecting them from risks becomes a primary goal of information system controls. Additionally, because firms can face serious consequences from external stakeholders in the event of a breach or outage, internal stakeholders also benefit from controls that protect the firm from litigation.</p>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h3>Cost-Benefit Analysis</h3>
			<p>The benefit of a control implementation is the reduction in either the <u><em>likelihood</em></u> of or <u><em>exposure</em></u> to problems. Likelihood is the probability of a problem, and exposure is the dollar loss from litigation, fines, lost business, cost of restoring a system and its data, etc., should a problem occur. Preventive controls can lower the likelihood of a problem, and detective and corrective controls can reduce the exposure (i.e., make a problem less bad or fix a problem more quickly). Any implementation of controls is costly, and although 100% prevention would be the best, the cost is prohibitive. As a result, the only option is a combination of all three types: preventing what can be prevented and detecting and correcting what cannot be prevented.</p>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h3>Control Frameworks</h3>
			<p>Many frameworks exist that address the various types of risk that external and internal stakeholders face. Four well-known examples are (1) Internal Control&ndash;Integrated Framework and (2) Enterprise Risk Management&ndash;Integrated Framework by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO); (3) Control Objectives for Information and Related Technology (COBIT) by the Information Systems and Audit Control Association (ISACA); and (4) Trust Services by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants (AICPA). The Control section of accounting architecture mirrors the principles of the Trust Services Framework. One reason for this choice is that Trust Services is an accountant's view of system controls.</p>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h3>Trust Services</h3>
			<div class="flex-row">
				<div class="flex-item override"><img src="../images/trust-services.png" alt="Trust Services Framework" style="max-width: 300px"/></div>
				<div class="flex-item" style="max-width: 70%">
					<p>Trust Services has a foundation and four pillars:</p>
					<ul>
						<li><u><em>Security</em></u> protects against unauthorized access.</li>
						<li><u><em>Availability</em></u> prevents data loss and system downtime.</li>
						<li><u><em>Processing integrity</em></u> preserves data integrity.</li>
						<li><u><em>Confidentiality</em></u> and <u><em>privacy</em></u> maintain secrets. Because of their similarity, these two occupy the same block in the Architecture.</li>
					</ul>

			<h3>Security</h3>
			<blockquote>The system is protected against unauthorized access, use, or modification.<br>&ndash; AICPA Trust Services Framework</blockquote>
			<p>Access controls are the primary security tool. They promote system security in one of three ways:</p>
			<ol>
				<li><u><em>Permissions</em></u> determine what users are authorized to do.</li>
				<li><u><em>Authentication</em></u> allows authorized users to identify themselves.</li>
				<li><u><em>Hardening</em></u> prevents unauthorized access.</li>
			</ol>

			<h3>Quote on Security</h3>
			<blockquote>Every company should have a team focused on security but it shouldn't end there. Security needs to be the responsibility of everyone.<br> &ndash; George Papayiannis, CTO, Vena Solutions</blockquote>

		<section>
			<h3>Why Permissions?</h3>
			<div class="flex-row">
				<!--License: CC-BY-SA 4.0 Attribution: DavidBailey-->
				<div class="flex-item override"><img src="../images/fraudtriangle.png" alt="Fraud Triangle" style="max-height: 400px"/></div>
				<div class="flex-item" style="max-width: 60%">
					<p>The purpose of permissions is two-fold. First, permissions prevent outsiders (e.g., non-employees) from gaining access to confidential materials. Second, correctly assigned permissions prevent insiders from gaining access to content that would increase the <em>opportunity</em> to commit fraud.</p>
				</div>
			</div>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h3>Segregation of Duties</h3>
			<p>Segregation of duties discourages the assignment of multiple incompatible duties to the same individual. General guidelines for identifying incompatible duties include:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>Authorization for a transaction should be separate from the processing of a transaction. For example, a sales person should not be able to authorize sale of inventory on credit and process the sales transaction. This prevents that creation of fraudulent transactions.</li>
				<li>Custody of assets should be separate from record-keeping. For example, the raw materials store should not be responsible for maintaining records of the levels of raw materials. This prevents asset theft.</li>
			</ol>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h3>Supervision</h3>
			<p>Segregation of duties is an excellent tool for discouraging fraud by requiring individuals to collude in order to succeed in performing and concealing the act. However, sometimes this tool is not available either because the number of available employees is too small and employees need to assume incompatible duties or because a single duty is risky (e.g., unloading inventory from a truck before it is counted or opening envelopes of cash in the mail room). In these situations, supervision is a second-best alternative.</p>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h3>Physical Access</h3>
			<p>Permissions can apply to physical and digital resources. Using a file server as an example, digital permissions determine which users have access to which files, and physical permissions dictate who may enter the server room where the file server hardware is stored. No amount of digital permissions replaces the need for physical permissions. If an attacker can gain access to the physical file server, then that user can gain access to any of the files on that server. <em>Physical access is total access</em>.</p>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h3>Digital Access</h3>
			<p>In our current cloud computing environment, most access is from remote locations (i.e., users on thin clients or workstations access a centralized web/database/file/email server or a shared printer). In these situations, permissions determine which users can use which physical devices (e.g., servers, printers) and which data objects (e.g., files, folders, database records, emails).</p>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h3>Database Permissions</h3>
			<p>Database permissions identify which users can (1) access the database and (2) initiate the four primary storage functions: <u><em>create</em></u>, <u><em>read</em></u>, <u><em>update</em></u>, and <u><em>delete</em></u> (CRUD). Create allows users to add new database records, read allows users to view existing records, update allows users to modify existing records, and delete allows users to remove records. Using SQL syntax as an example, the four basic commands are CREATE (or INSERT INTO), SELECT, UPDATE and DELETE. Each maps directly into one of the four storage functions.</p>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h3>File Permissions</h3>
			<p>Permissions in common file systems are less granular. Instead of identifying permissions for four storage functions, file systems focus on three functions: read, write, and execute. The overlap between file read and database read is apparent, but the other two file system functions are less similar to database functions. Create, update, and delete are all write functions because write permissions award the ability to edit. Execute governs launching applications. This permission has no useful meaning in a database setting. These three levels ostensibly match the three protections in the AICPA definition of security: <em>access</em> (read), <em>use</em> (execute), <em>modification</em> (write).</p>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h3>Folder Permissions</h3>
			<p>File systems comprise both files and folders, and although the same three permissions (read, write, and execute) govern both files and folders, the interpretation differs between files and folders. Read allows the user to see the contents of a folder. Write allows a user to modify the contents of a folder. Execute allows the user to open a folder and interact with its contents. The distinction between read and execute is, perhaps, a bit ambiguous; for Windows and OS X users (and any users of graphical file browsers), execute is the relevant permission for viewing folder contents.</p>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h3>Me Against the World</h3>
			<p>In addition to three functions (read, write, and execute), file permissions apply separately to three different types of users: owner (or user), group, and world (or others). Owner and world are easy to understand: owner is the (usually) the creator of a file or folder; world is everyone who has no ownership. Group is a collection of users that need some access but less access than the owner. The owner may or may not belong to the group.</p>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h3>Symbolic Notation</h3>
			<p>Unix-like (i.e., POSIX) operating systems display file permissions in two different but equivalent ways. One is more readable and one is more concise. Symbolic notation, the more readable format, uses ten characters to explain whether the owner, group, or world can read (r), write (w), or execute (e). Missing permissions are replaced with hyphens.</p>

		<section>
			<h3>First Character</h3>
			<p>Symbolic notation uses nine characters (i.e., three triads), but the string contains ten spaces. The first character identifies the file type: regular file (-), directory (d), or link (l). Several other file types exist, but these three are the most useful examples of symbolic notation.</p>
			<img src="../images/symbolic-notation.png" alt="Permissions in Symbolic Notation"/>
			<p>(This screenshot is of the output of the &lsquo;ls -l&rsquo; command&mdash;these are lowercase L's. In this case, ubuntu is the name of the owner, and the name of the group is also ubuntu.)</p>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h3>Octal Permissions</h3>
			<p>Numeric notation, frequently referred to as octal or octet permissions, uses base-8 notation to report permissions. In this notation, &lsquo;read&rsquo; receives a value of 4, &lsquo;write&rsquo; a value of 2, and &lsquo;execute&rsquo; a value of 1. These are added together to obtain one value for each of three significant digits. The first digit reports owner permissions, the second reports group permissions, and the third reports world permissions.</p>
			<img src="../images/numeric-notation.png" alt="Permissions in Numeric Notation"/>
			<p>(This screenshot is of the same files as in the previous slide or purposes of comparing numeric and symbolic notation of the same data objects.)
		</section>

		<section>
			<h3>One User to Rule Them All</h3>
			<p>In any system, whether file or database, every data object must have an owner. In Unix-like operating systems, most users only own content that they create. This prevents unauthorized access to and manipulation of system files. These files belong to <em><u>root</u></em>, also called the superuser or system user. In addition to owning the system files, the root user has full access to all files owned by any other user. Popular database systems also employ a root user who has all privileges and can grant those privileges to other users.</p>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h3><a href="http://xkcd.com/149/" target="_blank" aria-label="Website opens in new window">Sudo Make Me a Sandwich</a></h3>
			<p>Because the root user owns system files, a normal user must obtain elevated permissions to alter the system (i.e., edit and delete system files or install applications). In Unix-like systems, this is often done by either changing to the root user using the &lsquo;su&rsquo; command or by prepending &lsquo;sudo&rsquo; to any command that requires elevated privileges. (For an amusing commentary on sudo, click the title of this slide.)</p>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h3>Just Say No</h3>
			<p>Because permissions can be difficult to navigate, some succumb to the temptation to use the root user for everything. However, the decision to log in as and use the root user for everything is a <em>worst-case scenario</em> for security and should never be done; it increases the likelihood of unauthorized or unintended changes to the system. Consistent use of the root user is a red flag that proper IT controls are either not in place or have been ignored.</p>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h3>*nix Groups</h3>
			<p>POSIX groups are faceted, not hierarchical, so in Unix-like operating systems, users can belong to multiple groups. These groups frequently have no useful interpretation outside of the system because they are designed to assign control of software and hardware. For example, the &lsquo;storage&rsquo; group allows its members to access storage volumes, such as the internal hard drive or external USB drives; the &lsquo;lp&rsquo; group allows its members to use printers and scanners; the &lsquo;admin&rsquo; group&mdash;sometimes called the &lsquo;sudo&rsquo; or &lsquo;wheel&rsquo; group&mdash;allows its members to use the sudo command to receive elevated privileges.</p>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h3>Business Groups</h3>
			<p>In addition to the default groups in a Unix-like system, administrators can create additional groups at will to serve business purposes. The idea of groups in a Unix-like system is to award multiple users similar privileges to data objects, and this concept of groups matches the definition of groups in the traditional business sense (i.e., teams or departments). Using groups in this setting allows for owners to have primary access to data objects and for members of the same group as the owner to have lesser access (e.g., the owner has read-write access, and the other group members have read-only access.)</p>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h3>Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)</h3>
			<p>Unfortunately, the emphasis of owner permissions over group permissions is incompatible with an important tenet of access controls: <em>permissions should be role- and not user-based</em>. Individual employees should not have access based on who they are, but rather based on their job description. By default, Unix-like systems are not equipped to set this kind of role-based permission, but supplemental tools exist that allow for assigning users in a Unix-like system to roles. Two popular examples are Security-Enhanced Linux (SELinux) controls permissions on a single computer, and Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) controls permissions on an entire LAN.</p>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h3>Examples of Role-based Permissions</h3>
			<p>Because many role-based permissions apply to database access, database permissions are useful for providing examples of RBAC.</p>

		<section>
			<h3>Authentication</h3>
			<p>Permissions determine what an authorized user may do; authentication allows authorized users to identify themselves. Authentication has three forms:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><u><em>Something the user knows</em></u>: a password or passphrase.</li>
				<li><u><em>Something the user has</em></u>: a badge, key card, or code generator.</li>
				<li><u><em>Something the user is</em></u>: biometrics, such as face, voice, or thumb print.</li>
			</ul>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h3>Secure Passwords</h3>
			<p>The protection that passwords provide is only effective if an unauthorized user cannot guess the password. Brute-force attacks involve a computer randomly guessing what a password might be and attempting to log in with that password. Simple passwords, such as words commonly found in the dictionary or simple strings of numbers, are easy targets. Requiring long (e.g. &gt;12 characters), frequently changed (e.g., every 90 days), complex (e.g., upper- and lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters) passwords reduces the success of brute-force attacks. Of course, none of this matters if the user adopts the bad habit of writing down passwords and storing them in an accessible location (e.g., next to that user's workstation).</p>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h3>Disagree to Disagree</h3>
			<p>Different groups have differing beliefs on the best type of secure password. Some like the <u><em>passphrase</em></u> which essentially converts a, potentially nonsensical, sentence into a password (e.g., iamamericaandyoucantoo). The benefits of a passphrase are length and ease of remembering (i.e., the user is less likely to write it down). It is possible to add uppercase letters, numbers, special characters, and even spaces to make the passphrase more secure. Others prefer the <u><em>randomly generated password</em></u> (e.g., qt^&P07*_!gh$). Because this is virtually impossible to remember, these users also prefer password managers (e.g., LastPass or 1Password) to store usernames and passwords.</p>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h3>Social Engineering</h3>
			<p>Another method that attackers use to acquire passwords is <u><em>social engineering</em></u>. This involves creating a seemingly legitimate situation that convinces the user to disclose login credentials. This frequently involves <u><em>phishing</em></u> calls or emails in which the attacker poses as an authorized individual (e.g., a customer service representative, supervisor, or IT employee) and asks for the user's credentials. One of the benefits of randomly-generated passwords coupled with password managers is that the user is less likely to know and be able to communicate the password.</p>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h3>Multifactor Authentication</h3>
			<p>Security and convenience are always trade-offs. Anything that is more difficult for unauthorized users to access is also more difficult for authorized users to access. However, in many situations, the cost of added inconvenience is well worth avoiding exposure. In the current climate, one form of authentication is rarely enough to avoid problems. Passwords can be compromised through brute force or social engineering, key cards go missing, face or voice recognition can be faked. A combination of these is better (e.g., a password and a time-based code or a key card and a hand print).</p>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h3>Time-based Codes</h3>
			<p>Although users can change passwords, over short periods of time (e.g., days or weeks), a password remains static. <u><em>Time-based codes</em></u> address the weakness of static passwords by creating a code that changes frequently, usually every minute. Historically, users would need to keep a small device with them that displayed the current code, but in the era of smartphones, these codes are often transmitted by SMS or mobile app. In order to guess the code, an attacker would need to have stolen a device or have guessed the algorithm that determines the sequence of codes. The latter is unlikely, and the former depends on the care the user places on protecting the device.</p>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h3>Remote Authentication</h3>
			<p>Just as an LDAP server can store permissions, it can also store credentials. This is handy for allowing users to identify themselves on multiple machines on the same network, but in order for it to work, the user must already be in the network (LAN). Remote Authentication Dial-in User Service (RADIUS) allows users outside of the network (WAN) to authenticate themselves to access LAN resources. RADIUS is often used in virtual private network (VPN) and wireless local area network (WLAN) (i.e., WiFi) access.</p>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h3>Hardening</h3>
			<p>Hardening prevents unauthorized users from circumventing permissions and authentication in order to gain access to a system by reducing the system's <u><em>surface of attack</em></u> (i.e., the number of potential targets for a remote hacking attempt):</p>
			<ul>
				<li><u><em>Enabling packet filters</em></u> restricts access to active network devices.</li>
				<li><u><em>Disabling services</em></u> reduces the number of active network ports.</li>
				<li><u><em>Deleting old permissions and credentials</em></u> prevents formerly authorized users from using resources fraudulently.</li>
			</ul>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h3>On Again, Off Again</h3>
			<p>Because it is possible to use authentication protocols to access a LAN from the WAN, or even an arbitrary networked device while in a LAN, it can also be possible to gain unauthorized access. <u><em>Firewalls</em></u>, or more generally packet filters, restrict network traffic to and from certain network ports on certain devices. Firewalls are only necessary to protect open ports. Open ports are TCP and UDP ports that actively listen for (i.e., receive network traffic). Servers, that is software daemons, need open ports in order to function (e.g., web and email servers and multiplayer online games), but each open port is vulnerable. As a result, the best method for protecting a network device is to disable all unnecessary services to close as many ports as possible.</p>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h3>Security Through Obscurity</h3>
			<p>One popular rationalization for failing to harden servers and network devices is the belief that unimportant networks (i.e., the networks of small businesses or residences) are too insignificant to become attack targets. Unfortunately, these individuals fail to realize the ease of finding and compromising weak networks. IPv4 has only 4 billion addresses, and with current computing power, it is possible to scan all of these in a matter of hours, or even minutes. That makes it easy to find all unimportant networks. IPv6, on the other hand, has enough potential addresses to shroud network devices in at least a little bit of obscurity, but that is not an excuse for failing to harden these devices.</p>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h3>Deauthorization</h3>
			<p>Permissions and authentication allow authorized users to perform intended functions. As users change roles or leave an organization, those same permissions and authentication credentials permit unintended and unauthorized access. This is a especially a concern when employees leave their jobs on negative terms and would use their prior credentials for nefarious purposes. All organizations should have a policy for the deletion of permissions and credentials as soon as any user's authorization level changes.</p>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h3>Prevention and Detection</h3>
			<p>Most access control tools <em>prevent</em> unauthorized access to digital resources. However, 100% prevention is not possible because hackers continually identify new attack methods. Many of these come through vulnerabilities, or <u><em>exploits</em></u> in existing software that attackers can use to gain access, sometimes root access, to the physical server. Because of this risk, additional detective controls are necessary to monitor system and look for attempts to access network devices, guess login credentials, or view unauthorized content.</p>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h3>Isolation</h3>
			<p>Because attackers can gain unauthorized access to services and can use that access to infiltrate other systems, one method of hardening is to isolate services from one another. This is one of the primary roles of both virtualization and containerization. Virtual machines and containers create environments that are isolated from each other. Any application run in a container cannot access any other container or the host kernel, and any operating system run in a virtual machine cannot access any other virtual machine or the computer hardware.</p>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h3>Accounting Tie-in</h3>
			<p>Internal controls and IT controls are important parts of an accountant's focus. This is especially true since SOX. The AICPA has created the Trust Services Framework to address the need for IT controls in order to prevent, detect, and correct fraud, misstatements in financial reports, data loss, system downtime, etc. External stakeholders are an important set of beneficiaries of these controls, but internal stakeholders also benefit because controls prevent fraud and misinformation. Because the Control section is based on the Trust Services Framework, the accounting tie-in is apparent.</p>
