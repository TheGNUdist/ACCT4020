					<p>Business processes are the activities that the information system should support and measure. The Business Model&mdash;a block in the foundation of the arch&mdash;encompasses these processes. As a result, an understanding of these processes is necessary in order to design an effective information system.</p>
				</div>
			</div>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h3>Informational Needs</h3>
			<p>The first step in designing an information system is understanding the informational needs of three groups: managers, regulators, and external stakeholders. Because of their extensive financial, management, and tax accounting knowledge, accountants have worthwhile training and experience in identifying informational needs. However, because each business is unique, a clear understanding of the business processes is necessary in order to provide valuable information. This is especially true in the current Information Era because precision of information provides competitive advantages like never before.</p>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h3>Processes</h3>
			<p>A <u><i>business process</i></u> is a series of tasks or activities that serve to transfer resources, goods, services, money, and/or information between two parties. For example, the sales order process includes the tasks for receiving an order from a customer and providing goods or services to the customer; the cash receipts process might involve receiving payments from customers; the purchase and cash payments process could be the exact opposite: purchasing goods and services from vendors and paying on vendor invoices.</p>
			<p>(Unfortunately, many also refer to the individual tasks within a process as processes, as well, which can cause confusion.)</p>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h3>Cycles</h3>
			<p>The business model is the sum of all business processes, but accountants frequently identify <u><i>cycles</i></u> as subgroupings of the business model. Two popular examples of business cycles are the revenue cycle and the expenditure cycle, although many accounting materials also reference a production or conversion cycle, a payroll cycle, and a general ledger cycle. The revenue cycle might include the sales order process, the cash receipts process, and the returns process for handling customer returns; the expenditure cycle could include the purchase process and the cash payments process.</p>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h3>Need for Flexibility</h3>
			<p>Just as financial accounting, tax, and auditing standards reflect differences in business models between companies and industries, the identification of relevant business cycles is also unique. For example, the production of inventory or fixed assets is no longer a relevant component of many business models, whereas given the importance of corporate taxes, a tax cycle might manifest. In a services firm, such as is common to public accounting, the distinction between the expenditure and payroll cycles may be negligent because employees are the primary assets of the firm. A company that deals primarily in the creation of open source software might not even have a revenue cycle.</p>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h3>A Word on Ledgers</h3>
			<p>Regulation&mdash;part of the Compliance block of the architecture&mdash;dictates the reporting of financial items in a specific fashion without much room for flexibility. As a result, a financial reporting cycle is vital, at least for public companies. (Because lenders may also require financial disclosures&mdash;another component of the Compliance block&mdash;the need for a financial reporting cycle is not unique to public companies.) However, that is not a prescription to have a general ledger or general ledger cycle. Journals and ledgers are merely an example of an information system. The information system is not restricted to one form, and informational needs, technological feasibility&mdash;the third foundational block&mdash;best practices, and preferences will dictate how to track accounting, tax, payroll, HR, etc., information.</p>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h3>What's the Point?</h3>
			<p>If information systems and business processes are unique to each organization, what is the point of teaching anything? It may not be possible to answer this question satisfactorily, but the truth is that an understanding of principles and examples makes it easier to adapt to unique situations in the future, so the goal becomes to provide exposure to new ideas, and open the door towards being able to acquire additional information about specific implementations.</p>
			<p>The tool to enable future learning about information systems is knowledge of the individual building blocks, and this is the focus of the accounting architecture. The tool to enable future learning about business models is the ability to read diagrams.</p>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h3>Diagram</h3>
			<div class="flex-row">
				<div class="flex-item" style="max-width:50%">
					<p>A diagram is a visual representation of logic useful for efficient communication. Diagrams are not the only tool for communicating a series of processes, but drawings are more efficient than narrations. They are frequently easier to understand and interpret. Because they can portray multiple parts of the whole at once, they can identify links between objects.</p>

			<h3>Diagrams in Action</h3>

		<section>
			<h3>Two Types of Models</h3>
			<ul>
				<li><u><i>Activity models</i></u> describe a series of tasks that comprise a system. This system may be a computer program or a business process or cycle involving many programs and people, called agents. Activity models track flow of resources, data, and control. Information systems focus on data flow, but control flow is also important.</li>
				<li><u><i>Structure models</i></u> describe the characteristics of people, assets, and data and their relationships with one another. Structure models are useful for creating conceptual models of data stores.</li>
			</ul>
			<p></p>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h3>Activity Model</h3>
			<div class="flex-row">
				<div class="flex-item"><img src="../images/accounting-curriculum.png" alt="Undergraduate Accounting Curriculum" style="max-height: 600px"/></div>
				<div class="flex-item" style="max-width:50%">
					<p>A curriculum plan is a simple example of an activity model. Passing a course represents one task, and the model demonstrates how to navigate the entire degree process. This model contains no data objects, so the purpose of the arrows is to demonstrate which tasks must precede others. This is an example of control flow.</p>
				</div>
			</div>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h3>Control Flow</h3>
			<p><u><i>Control flow</i></u> determines which tasks in a process may execute in which order. A traditional card game illustrates this principle. If one turn involves (1) requesting cards and (2) placing a bet, then the requesting cards activity must complete before placing a bet, and both activities must complete before the next player can have a turn. The current task has control, and when it completes, control is passed to the next task.</p>
			<p>(The accounting architecture arch has a Control section, but this is a different use of the word.)</p>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h3>Data Flow</h3>
			<p>Data flow is simpler to understand than control flow. The purpose of many process tasks, especially the measurement and reporting tasks familiar to accountants, is to create data. Data flow tracks data creation, use, and storage by identifying which task creates the data, which tasks use the data, and where the data is stored. A straightforward example would be a sample sales order process. The customer contacts the sales rep to place an order; the sales rep creates a sales order that the inventory warehouse uses to fill the order; the warehouse passes the sales order to billing department, so that the billing department can create an invoice to send to the customer.</p>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h3>Modeling Standards</h3>
			<p>In order to understand the principles of data and control flow, it is best to view actual diagrams. The curriculum diagram is a rudimentary example, but many diagrams adhere to specific frameworks that include templates (i.e., predefined sets of shapes), and it is necessary to recognize these shapes in order to be able to read and write proper diagrams. Three well-known examples are of diagramming frameworks are:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Flowcharts</li>
				<li>Data flow diagrams (DFD)</li>
				<li>Business Process Model and Notation (BPMN)</li>
			</ul>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h3>Flowchart Shapes</h3>
			<div class="override"><img src="../images/Flowchart.png" alt="Flowchart Shapes"/></div>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h3>Sample Flowchart</h3>
			<div class="override"></div>
			<div class="flex-row">
				<div class="flex-item override"><img src="../images/sample-flowchart.png" alt="Sample Flowchart"/></div>
				<div class="flex-item" style="max-width: 70%">
					<p>Inventory Control reviews inventory levels and generates a purchase requisition for inventory. (This might occur if inventory has fallen below its reorder point.) Inventory Control then files a copy of the purchase requisition and sends a copy to the Purchasing Department. The Purchasing Department generates a purchase order, files a copy of the purchase order with the purchase requisition, sends a copy of the purchase order to Inventory Control to file with Inventory Control's copy of the purchase requisition, and sends a copy of the purchase order to the Vendor.</p>
				</div>
			</div>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h3>Flowchart Conventions</h3>
			<p>In addition to a set of prescribed shapes, diagramming frameworks also stipulate drawing conventions to increase readability. For example:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Flowcharts are read from top to bottom and left to right.</li>
				<li>Flow of data and control is signified by arrows with arrowheads.</li>
				<li>Arrows should only point vertically or horizontally with 90&deg; angles.</li>
				<li>For system flowcharts with multiple agents, flowcharts are subdivided into swimlanes, which are columns that signify which activities belong to which agent.</li>
			</ul>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h3>Data Flow Diagrams</h3>
			<p>Two different groups introduced nearly identical templates for DFDs:</p>
			<div class="override"><img src="../images/DFD.png" alt="DFD Shapes"/>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h3>Sample DFD</h3>
			<div class="flex-row">
				<div class="flex-item override"><img src="../images/sample-dfd.png" alt="Sample DFD"/></div>
				<div class="flex-item" style="max-width: 41%">
					<p>The Vendor sends an invoice. The invoice is compared to the purchase order for discrepancies. Once the invoice is approved, a check is signed and sent to the Vendor. A journal entry is added to the cash disbursements journal, and a journal voucher is used to update the accounts payable subledger.</p>
				</div>
			</div>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h3>DFD Conventions</h3>
			<ul>
				<li>Flow of data and control is signified by arrows with arrowheads just as with flowcharts.</li>
				<li>Because DFDs have no data shapes other than data stores, the data transfered from step to step is displayed as a label next to the arrow between the two steps.</li>
				<li>Gane-Sarson arrows only point vertically or horizontally with 90&deg; angles, but Yourdon arrows can point in any direction and even curve.</li>
				<li>DFDs have no predetermined direction or swimlanes.</li>
			</ul>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h3>Simplicity &ne; Readability</h3>
			<p>Unlike flowcharts which have a large set of shapes to increase specificity, data flow diagrams promote simplicity by restricting themselves to three simple shapes. The large flowchart template can also result in a large number of shapes and a cluttered diagram, which reduces readability. However, simplicity will not always increase readability. For example, the lack of specific arrow conventions for Yourdon DFDs, and the lack of predetermined direction for DFDs reduces the number of requirements for DFDs but they conflict with a preference to read from top to bottom and left to right. Additionally, the lack of swimlanes obscures accountability (i.e., who performs a task), which is important information for accountants and auditors. As a result, DFDs may be better for high-level and flowcharts better for low-level perspectives.</p>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h3>Business Process Model and Notation</h3>
			<p>Business Process Model and Notation (BPMN) is an attempt to create a modeling notation specifically for business processes that promotes collaboration between operations specialists who design the process, managers who use the process, and technologists who support the process. BPMN comprises multiple diagram types, and these different types follow different conventions and rely on different templates. Two examples are <u><i>collaborations</i></u>, which are similar to flowcharts and <u><i>choreographies</i></u>, which are similar to DFDs.</p>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h3>Ad-hoc</h3>
			<p>The ability to read and write flowcharts and DFDs provides a valuable basis for understanding and communicating business processes, a basis which is not necessarily improved by exposure to yet another diagramming framework. Part of the reason for this is that when attempting to describe a process, individuals may create diagrams on the spot that follow no prescribed framework. The measure of a diagram is not is adherence to templates, but rather its ability to share information. The skill of reading and writing flowcharts and DFDs simply increases the likelihood of being able to create and read useful diagrams.</p>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h3>Comprehensive Example</h3>
			<div class="override"><img src="../images/dfd-cycles.png" alt="Cycles"/>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h3>Accounting Tie-in</h3>
			<p>Accountants benefit from diagrams in multiple ways. Auditors receive diagrams from clients in order to understand the clients' processes. This understanding helps auditors to know where misstatements are most likely to arise. Accountants also use diagrams to understand the business model so that they can know what to measure and report on for financial, management, and tax accounting purposes. This understanding of the business model is a necessary first step in implementing an information system. Because accountants have business expertise, they are better equipped than IT staff to understand business processes. This makes accountants valuable players in the design of information systems.</p>
