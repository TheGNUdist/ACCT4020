			<h3>Accounting Architecture</h3>

				<div class="flex-item" style="max-width: 65%">
					<p>Business processes are the activities that the information system should support and measure. The Business Model&mdash;a block in the foundation of the arch&mdash;encompasses these processes. As a result, an understanding of these processes is necessary in order to design an effective information system.</p>
				</div>
			</div>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h3>Informational Needs</h3>
			<p>The first step in designing an information system is understanding the informational needs of three groups: managers, regulators, and external stakeholders. Because of their extensive financial, management, and tax accounting knowledge, accountants have worthwhile training and experience in identifying informational needs. However, because each business is unique, a clear understanding of the business processes is necessary in order to provide valuable information. This is especially true in the current Information Era because precision of information provides competitive advantages like never before.</p>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h3>Processes</h3>
			<p>A business process is a series of tasks or activities that serve to transfer resources, goods, services, or money, or information between two parties. For example, the sales order process includes the tasks for receiving a order from a customer and providing goods or services to the customer; the cash receipts process might involve receiving payments from customers; the purchase and cash payments process could be the exact opposite: purchase goods and services from vendors and paying on vendor invoices.</p>
			<p>(Unfortunately, many also refer to the individual tasks within a process as processes, as well, which can cause confusion.)</p>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h3>Cycles</h3>
			<p>The business model is the sum of all business processes, but accountants frequently identify <u><i>cycles</i></u> as subgroupings of the business model. Two popular examples of business cycles are the revenue cycle and the expenditure cycle, although many accounting materials also reference a production or conversion cycle, a payroll cycle, and a general ledger cycle. The revenue cycle might include the sales order process, the cash receipts process, and the returns process for handling customer returns; the expenditure cycle could include the purchase process and the cash payments process.</p>
		</section>
		
		<section>
			<h3>Need for Flexibility</h3>
			<p>Just as financial accounting, tax, and auditing standards reflect differences in business models between companies and industries, the identification of relevant business cycles is also unique. For example, the production of inventory or fixed assets is no longer a relevant component of many business models, whereas given the importance of corporate taxes, a tax cycle might manifest. In a services firm, such as is common to public accounting, the distinction between the expenditure and payroll cycles may be negligent because employees are the primary assets of the firm. A company that deals primarily in the creation of open source software might not even have a revenue cycle.</p>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h3>A Word on Ledgers</h3>
			<p>Regulation&mdash;part of the Compliance block of the architecture&mdash;dictates the reporting of financial items in a specific fashion without much room for flexibility. As a result, a financial reporting cycle is vital, at least for public companies. (Because lenders may also require financial disclosures&mdash;another component of the Compliance block&mdash;the need for a financial reporting cycle is not unique to public companies.) However, that is not a prescription to have a general ledger or general ledger cycle. Journals and ledgers are merely an example of an information system. The information system is not restricted to one form, and informational needs, technological feasibility&mdash;the third foundational block&mdash;best practices, and preferences will dictate how to track accounting, tax, payroll, HR, etc., information.</p>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h3>What's the Point?</h3>
			<p>If information systems and business processes are unique to each organization, what is the point of teaching anything? It may not be possible to answer this question satisfactorily, but the truth is that an understanding of principles and examples makes it easier to adapt to unique situations in the future, so the goal becomes to provide exposure to new ideas, and open the door towards being able to acquire additional information about specific implementations.</p>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h3>Learning Tool</h3>
			<p>The tool to enable future learning about information systems is knowledge of the individual building blocks, and this is the focus of the Accounting Architecture. The tool to enable future learning about business models is the ability to read diagrams.</p>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h3>Diagram</h3>
			<div class="flex-row">
				<div class="flex-item" style="max-width:50%">
					<p>A visual representation of logic useful for efficient communication. Diagrams are not the only tool for communicating a series of processes, but drawings are more efficient than narrations. They are frequently easier to understand and interpret. Because they can portray multiple parts of the whole at once, they can identify links between objects.</p>

			<h3>Diagrams in Action</h3>
			<div class="flex-row" style="-webkit-justify-content: flex-start; justify-content: flex-start">
				<div class="flex-item" style="max-width: 90%"><blockquote>I'm going to make a flow process chart for each of the parts that make up the gun. These charts will show, step by step, how the part is made.<br>&ndash; Alan Mogensen</blockquote></div>

			</div>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h3>Two Types of Models</h3>
			<ul>
				<li><u><i>Activity models</i></u> describe a series of tasks that comprise a system. This system may be a computer program or a business process or cycle involving many programs and people, called agents. Activity models track flow of resources, data, and control. Information systems focus on data flow, but control flow is also important.</li>
				<li><u><i>Structure models</i></u> describe the characteristics of people, assets, and data and their relationships with one another. Structure models are useful for creating conceptual models of data stores.</li>
			</ul>
			<p></p>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h3>Activity Model</h3>
			<div class="flex-row">
				<div class="flex-item"><img src="../images/accounting-curriculum.png" alt="Undergraduate Accounting Curriculum" style="max-height: 600px"/></div>
				<div class="flex-item" style="max-width:50%">
					<p>A curriculum plan is a simple example of an activity model. Passing a course represents one task, and the model demonstrates how to navigate the entire degree process. This model contains no data objects, so the purpose of the arrows is demonstrate which tasks must precede others. This is an example of control flow.</p>
				</div>
			</div>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h3>Control Flow</h3>
			<p><u><i>Control flow</i></u> determines which tasks in a process may execute in which order. A traditional card game illustrates this principle. If one turn involves (1) requesting cards and (2) placing a bet, then the requesting cards activity must complete before placing a bet, and both activities must complete before the next player can have a turn. The current task has control, and when it completes, control is passed to the next task.</p>
			<p>(The Accounting Architecture has a Control section, but this is a different use of the word.)</p>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h3>Data Flow</h3>
			<p>Data flow is simpler to understand than control flow. The purpose of many process tasks, especially the measurement and reporting tasks familiar to accountants, is to create data. Data flow tracks data creation, use, and storage by identifying which task creates the data, which tasks use the data, and where the data is stored. A straightforward example would be a sample sales order process. The customer contacts the sales rep to place an order; the sales rep creates a sales order that the inventory warehouse uses to fill the order; the warehouse passes the sales order to billing department, so that the billing department can create an invoice to send to the customer.</p>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h3>Modeling Standards</h3>
			<p>In order to understand the principles of data and control flow, it is best to view actual diagrams. The curriculum diagram is a rudimentary example, but many diagrams adhere to specific frameworks that include templates (i.e., predefined sets of shapes), and it is necessary to recognize these shapes in order to be able to read and write proper diagrams. Four well-known examples are of diagramming frameworks are:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Flowcharts</li>
				<li>Data flow diagrams (DFD)</li>
				<li>Unified Modeling Language (UML) Activity Diagrams</li>
				<li>Business Process Model and Notation (BPMN)</li>
			</ul>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h3>Flowchart Shapes</h3>
			<div class="override"><img src="../images/Flowchart.png" alt="Flowchart Shapes"/></div>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h3>Sample Flowchart</h3>
			<div class="override"><img src="../images/sample-flowchart.png" alt="Sample Flowchart" style="max-height: 550px"/></div>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h3>Narrative</h3>
			<p>Inventory Control reviews inventory levels and generates a purchase requisition for inventory. (This might occur if inventory has fallen below its reorder point.) Inventory Control then files a copy of the purchase requisition and sends a copy to the Purchasing Department. The Purchasing Department generates a purchase order, files a copy of the purchase order with the purchase requisition, sends a copy of the purchase order to Inventory Control to file with Inventory Control&rdquo;s copy of the purchase requisition, and sends a copy of the purchase order to the Vendor.</p>
			<p>(This terse narrative demonstrates that the communication of even a simple process with few steps benefits from a diagram.)
		</section>

		<section>
			<h3>Flowchart Conventions</h3>
			<p>In addition to a set of prescribed shapes, diagramming frameworks also stipulate drawing conventions to increase readability. For example:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Flowcharts are read from top to bottom and left to right.</li>
				<li>Flow of data and control is signified by arrows with arrowheads.</li>
				<li>Arrows should only point vertically or horizontally with 90&deg; angles.</li>
				<li>For system flowcharts with multiple agents, flowcharts are subdivided into swimlanes, which are columns that signify which activities belong to which agent.</li>
			</ul>
		</section>
		
		<section>
			<h3>Data Flow Diagrams</h3>
			<p>Two different groups introduced nearly identical templates for DFDs:</p>
			<div class="override"><img src="../images/DFD.png" alt="DFD Shapes"/>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h3>Sample DFD</h3>
			<div class="override"><img src="../images/sample-dfd.png" alt="Sample DFD" style="max-height: 450px"/>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h3>Narrative</h3>
			<p>The Vendor sends an invoice. The invoice is compared to the purchase order for discrepancies. Once the invoice is approved, a check is signed and sent to the Vendor. A journal entry is added to the cash disbursements journal, and a journal voucher is used to update the accounts payable subledger.</p>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h3>DFD Conventions</h3>
			<ul>
				<li>Flow of data and control is signified by arrows with arrowheads just as with flowcharts.</li>
				<li>Because DFDs have no data shapes other than data stores, the data transfered from step to step is displayed as a label next to the arrow between the two steps.</li>
				<li>Gane-Sarson arrows only point vertically or horizontally with 90&deg; angles, but Yourdon arrows can point in any direction and even curve.</li>
				<li>DFDs have no predetermined direction or swimlanes.</li>
			</ul>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h3>Simplicity &ne; Readability</h3>
			<p>Unlike flowcharts which have a large set of shapes to increase specificity, data flow diagrams promote simplicity by restricting themselves to three simple shapes. The large flowchart template can also result in a large number of shapes and a cluttered diagram, which reduces readability. However, simplicity will not always increase readability. For example, the lack of specific arrow conventions for Yourdon DFDs, and the lack of predetermined direction for DFDs reduces the number of requirements for DFDs but they conflict with a preference to read from top to bottom and left to right. Additionally, the lack of swimlanes obscures accountability (i.e., how performs a task), which is important information for accountants and auditors.</p>
		</section>
			
		<section>
			<h3>DFD Levels</h3>
			<p>Some process tasks might have multiple steps. DFDs levels allow for a convenient presentation of tasks decomposed into subtasks. The highest level DFD (Level 0) numbers processes with whole numbers (1, 2, 3, etc). The second level (Level 1) adds a decimal after the number of the decomposed process (Process 1 becomes 1.1, 1.2, 1.3, etc.). The third level (Level 2) adds an additional decimal number (Process 1.3 becomes 1.3.1, 1.3.2, etc.)</p>
		</section>
		
		<section>
			<h3>Unified Modeling Language</h3>
			<p>UML has may different types of diagrams: class, object, package, activty, etc., and each serves a different purpose. UML activity diagrams portray processes. The shapes for activity diagrams have changed considerably from UML 1 to UML 2. These are the main UML 2 shapes:</p>
			<div class="override"><img src="../images/UML.png" alt="UML Shapes"/></div>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h3>Sample UML</h3>
			<div class="override"><img src="../images/sample-uml.png" alt="Sample UML" style="max-height: 450px"/>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h3>(Technical) Narrative</h3>
			<p>When the ORDER ACTIVITY is invoked, a control token is placed at the initial node, and a data token with ordering information is placed at the input parameter object node. The control token flows from the initial node to the CREATE ORDER action, which begins executing. The data token flows from the parameter to the invocation action for FILL ORDER, which must wait for CREATE ORDER to provide its other input before starting. When FILL ORDER is done, a control token is passed to the final node and the activity terminates, returning control to execution that started it.</p>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h3>Business Process Model and Notation</h3>
			<ul>
				<li>2000: Business Process Management Initiative (BPMI) is formed to promote the development of business process management tools.</li>
				<li>2004: BPMN 1.0 is released.</li>
				<li>2005: BPMI merges with the Object Management Group.</li>
				<li>2010: BPMN 2.0 is released.</li>
				<li>2013: International Organization for Standardization accepts BPMN 2.0 as an ISO standard.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>BPMN is an attempt to create a modeling notation specifically for business processes that promotes collaboration between operations specialists who design the process, managers who use the process, and technologists who support the process.</p>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h3>BPMN Adoption</h3>
			<p>Although BPMN finds its roots in UML activity diagrams, BPMN seems to have surpassed UML in popularity as the <i>de facto</i> process diagramming solution. This may be the result of its focus on business processes instead of the more agnostic perspective of activity diagrams and flowcharts with respect to computer logic and business processes.</p>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h3>BPMN 2.0 Basic Shapes</h3>
			<div class="override"><img src="../images/BPMN.png" alt="Basic BPMN Shapes"/></div>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h3>Advanced Shapes</h3>
			<p>BPMN is different from other models in one interesting way. Although it wants to allow for many different situations, instead of adopting many different shapes or only a few shapes which ignore the specifics of the object, BPMN uses a few shapes and adds icons to the shapes to incorporate specificity.</p>
			<div class="override"><img src="../images/BPMNAdvanced.png" alt="Advanced BPMN Shapes"/></div>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h3>BPMN Conventions</h3>
			<ul>
				<li>Unlike flowcharts, swimlanes in BPMN are generally horizontal rows, not vertical columns.</li>
				<li>Diagrams are read left-to-right and top-to-bottom.</li>
				<li>Control and data flow lines are horizontal or vertical with 90&deg; angles, but unlike flowcharts and DFD, the angles have rounded corners.</li>
			</ul>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h3>Four Types of Diagrams</h3>
			<ul>
				<li><u><i>Orchestrations</i></u> place all agents lanes into a single pool and hide communications between them.</li>
				<li><u><i>Collaborations</i></u> place agents into discrete pools and show communications between them.</li>
				<li><u><i>Conversations</i></u> discard pools and swimlanes and depict agents as individual objects and the communications between them as black boxes.</li>
				<li><u><i>Choreographies</i></u> discard pools and swimlanes and portray individual interactions between agents as single objects.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>For our purposes, diagrams that explicitly portray communication are superior because communication is data flow.</p>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h3>Sample Collaboration</h3>
			<div class="override"><img src="../images/sample-collaboration.png" alt="Sample BPMN Collaboration" style="max-height: 650px"/>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h3>Narrative</h3>
			<p>The Help Desk receives a ticket from the customer and searches the help-desk database for a solution. If the Help Desk finds a solution, it sends the solution to the customer. Otherwise, it sends a message to the expert. When the Help Desk receives a response from the expert, it sends the solution to the customer.</p>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h3>Sample Choreography</h3>
			<div class="override"><img src="../images/sample-choreography.png" alt="Sample BPMN Choreography" style="max-height: 650px"/>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h3>BPMN Strengths and Weaknesses</h3>
			<ul>
				<li>Strengths</li>
				<ul>
					<li>Use of flowchart-style swimlanes highlights accountability. Choreographies uniquely capture accountability without swimlanes.</li>
					<li>BPMN can combine all four types of diagrams into any single drawing.</li>
					<li>BPMN allows for sub-processes in the top level diagram, instead of requiring subsequent diagrams as in DFDs.</li>
				</ul>
				<li>Weaknesses</li>
				<ul>
					<li>Large number of different shapes, sub-shapes, and lines can prevent uniform application of BPMN.</li>
					<li>Not designed to model the flow of data.</li>
				</ul>
			</ul>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h3>Communication But Not Data Flow</h3>
			<p>The two previous slides may seem contradictory. Some BPMN diagrams explicitly portray communication, and communication is data flow, but BPMN is not designed to model the flow of data. Oddly enough, all of these statements are true. BPMN can model the flow of data, but the developers of BPMN definitively state that the purpose of BPMN is not to model data flow. This renders BPMN less useful for our purposes.</p>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h3>Accounting Tie-in</h3>
			<p>Accountants benefit from diagrams in multiple ways. For example, auditors receive flowcharts from firms in order to understand the firm's processes. This understanding helps auditors to know where misstatements are most likely. Accountants also use flowcharts to understand what processes to measure for financial, managerial, and tax accounting purposes. Accounting architects use flowcharts to understand informational needs of the processes in order to facilitate data flow.</p>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h3>Homework</h3>
			<p><u>Part 1</u></p>
			<p>On the course portal, you will find a process diagram. Your assignment is to read the diagram and type a narrative explaining the process in your own words. The goal is to demonstrate that you have learned how to read and understand diagrams.</p>
			<p><u>Part 2</u></p>
			<p>Now, using the same process diagram, you should create a replica. You may use any diagramming software that you choose, but I recommend that you use <a href="https://www.draw.io/">Draw.io</a> because it is the tool that I demonstrate in class. Be sure to include your name on your submission as evidence that it is your own work.</p>
