					<p>The Software block of the accounting architecture framework is the most multi-faceted block of the Technology section. This block covers multiple topics related to software and software development. The first of these is open source. Though not exclusively a software issue, open source and open content, more generally, has completely reshaped the computing world. Understanding software in accounting architecture begins with understanding what open source is.</p>

			<h2>Proprietary IP</h2>
			<ul>
				<li><u><em>Copyright</em></u> prohibits making, transmitting, displaying, or selling copies or derivatives of a work.</li>
				<li><u><em>Patent</em></u> prohibits making, using, or selling an invention.</li>
				<li><u><em>Trademark</em></u> prohibits use of a name, symbol, figure, letter, word, or mark adopted and used by a manufacturer or merchant.</li>
				<li><u><em>Non-disclosure agreement</em></u> restricts disclosure of information to external parties.</li>
				<li><u><em>Non-compete clause</em></u> prevents use of trade secrets in a competing enterprise.</li>
			</ul>
			<p style="text-align: center">These all restrict use of <em><u>intellectual property</u></em> (IP).</p>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h2>Proprietary Is Licensed</h2>
			<p>The creator of intellectual property automatically has all rights to that creation. As a result, a tool is necessary to award third parties certain rights so that creator retains ownership while letting others benefit from the creation. A <u><em>license</em></u> serves this purpose. It allows the owner of intellectual property to grant privileges to others without giving up ownership.</p>
			<p>(This is the legal text that no one reads but everyone agrees to when installing software, signing up for an online service, etc.)</p>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h2>Proprietary is Closed</h2>
			<p>Licensing encourages invention by protecting the inventor. To put it in a business context, companies may not be as willing to invest millions into R&amp;D unless they could protect their investment. Licenses let users view movies and shows, listen to music, read books, install software, etc., while ensuring that the creator retains ownership. However, a side-effect of proprietary licenses is the formation of black boxes. No one can investigate the creation, make changes to it, or share the creation with others. Proprietary licenses create <u><em>closed content</em></u>.</p>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h2>Open is Open</h2>
			<p>The premise of <u><em>open content</em></u> is that the creator of intellectual property make the creation <em><u>freely available</u></em> for others to <u><em>view</em></u>, <u><em>inspect</em></u>, <u><em>modify</em></u>, <u><em>reuse</em></u>, and <u><em>redistribute</em></u>. The Modern Paradigm for Standards identifies the following benefits of open content:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><u><em>Interoperability</em></u>: the ability of a product, system, or practice to work with other products, systems, or practices.</li>
				<li><u><em>Transparency</em></u>: the subjection of a creation or process to public scrutiny.</li>
				<li><u><em>Innovation</em></u>: the facilitation of the creation to new ideas.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Open content encourages invention and innovation by making knowledge about prior inventions more widely accessible.</p>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h2>Proprietary Was Open Once</h2>
			<p>Innovation is necessary for a society to progress. The ability to create new ideas and inventions encourages competition, which in turn, encourages additional innovation. Interestingly, the United States created the Patent Office so that inventors would publish the specifications of their inventions in order to promote additional innovation. Unfortunately, patents now serve the exact opposite purpose, and patent holders sue whenever someone has a similar creation. This discourages competition, innovation, and improvement, and society suffers as a result.</p>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h2>Many Types of Closed and Open</h2>
			<ul>
				<li><u><em>Access</em></u>: the availability of creative works</li>
				<li><u><em>Standard</em></u>: a set of specifications</li>
				<li><u><em>Format</em></u>: a standard for storage of digital media</li>
				<li><u><em>Design</em></u>: hardware or software schematics</li>
				<li><u><em>System</em></u>: interconnected hardware and software components</li>
			</ul>
			<p>These terms have alternative definitions in other settings, but these definitions apply to the context of open content. Each term embraces both closed and open content (e.g., some standards are closed standards and others are open standards).</p>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h2>Open Access</h2>
			<p>Of the types of open content, open access may be the easiest to comprehend. Closed access requires a user to pay in order to use creative works (e.g., music, videos, books, articles) and prohibits any sharing or modification of the created work. Film and record studios reinforce this point when denouncing piracy.</p>
			<p>Open access gives users free access to use and reuse creative works. Free use of creative works means not needing to pay royalties for accessing, reading, viewing, or listening to content. Free reuse means being able to share the content with others, as well as make changes to the content and share the changes with others.</p>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h2>Closed Access Excludes Customers</h2>
			<p>Although closed access to creative content is a popular method for ensuring that creators, such as actors, singers, and studios, are paid for their efforts, it also creates problems. Two examples are (1) inability to filter and (2) inability to learn.</p>
			<p>Because films can contain inappropriate content, some viewers would like to watch the film but filter the content. In the past, businesses have arisen that filter film content and redistribute the films. Film studios shut these business down for modifying closed content. Instead of providing these potential customers with the opportunity to acquire filtered versions of films, by shutting these business down, film studios excluded these customers from the market for these films completely.</p>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h2>Closed Access Prevents Learning</h2>
			<p>The fact that closed access restricts the ability to consume entertainment is likely not a major issue, but restricting access to knowledge is.</p>
			<p>Academics and scientists conduct and publish research in order to discover and share new knowledge. The journals never pay researchers, but the researcher must sign over the copyright to the journal in order have the research published. The journal then charges individuals, libraries, and universities (exorbitant) rates for individual articles and journal subscriptions. Only those who can afford to pay can access the knowledge and learn from it, which excludes many libraries and universities, especially in poorer countries. This creates different ability to learn based on wealth.</p>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h2>Creative Commons</h2>
			<p><u><em>Creative Commons</em></u> is a series of open access licenses for creative works with a combination conditions:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><u><em>Attribution</em></u> (BY) requires identifying the original creator in any reuse.</li>
				<li><u><em>Share-alike</em></u> (SA) forces the license of derivative works to be the same as the original.</li>
				<li><u><em>Non-commercial</em></u> (NC) prevents the use or reuse of the work for commercial purposes (i.e., for profit).</li>
				<li><u><em>No Derivative Works</em></u> (ND) allows only verbatim copies.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>The more conditions a CC license includes, the stricter it becomes. A CC license with no conditions (CC0) and is the same as placing a work in the <u><em>public domain</em></u>.</p>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h2>Public Domain</h2>
			<p>Unlike an open access license, which allows the creator to stipulate how a creative work can be reused, placing a creation in the public domain strips the creator of any rights to the work. This decision may be appropriate when the creator no longer has any interest in the work or when the creator is already dead&mdash;many classical works are in the public domains, although modern performances of classical works are not&mdash;but it is less appropriate when the creator wants to share while retaining ownership and control. Open access licenses mimic the public domain by making the work freely available, and they mimic closed content by giving the creator final say over what is and is not allowed.</p>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h2>Open Standards and Formats</h2>
			<p>It is difficult to explain the benefit of open standards and formats. One reason for this is that the end-user is seemingly shielded from the costs of using closed standards and formats. A perfect example of this is MP3, a closed file format for audio. It is the most widely adopted file format for audio, and as a result, it seems highly interoperable, meaning that many devices can play MP3 files. However, every time Apple produces an iPhone that can play MP3 files, it must pay a licensing fee because the owner of the MP3 format requires a royalty in return for the ability to play audio files with that format. That cost is then surreptitiously passed to the customer in the form of higher prices, but since the customers want an iPhone anyway, who cares, right?</p>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h2>More Obvious Benefit</h2>
			<p>Perhaps this example will convince a few of you. That same iPhone uses a Lightning connector, which is a closed standard. If a customer wants a replacement cable, the two choices are to pay Apple's prices for a new cable or to purchase a third-party replica. However, that third party paid Apple a royalty in order to be able to produce cables compliant with that closed standard, and the manufacturer certainly passed those costs on to the customer.</p>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h2>Closed Systems</h2>
			<p>Apple is a veritable treasure trove of examples of closed content. Unlike PCs, Macs are closed systems, meaning that the combination of hardware and software is restricted. Some end-users like the closed-system model because they believe that it &ldquo;just works,&rdquo; but one of the costs is the requirement to purchase Apple hardware in order to use OS X. Anyone who has ever looked at the price tag for a Mac knows the implications of this requirement. (Oh, and the same closed system applies to the iPhone, as well: no iOS without the iPhone hardware.)</p>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h2>A Much Bigger Example</h2>
			<p>These examples explain some of the drawbacks of closed formats and standards. On the other hand, we all benefit immensely from one particular open standard: the World Wide Web. (As an aside, the Internet is a combination of networks that allows for communication around the world; the World Wide Web is the content that we access via the Internet.) Because the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) leaves this standard open, anyone can add and access content royalty-free. We can all appreciate that, especially considering that these course materials rely completely on this open technology.</p>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h2>Widely Used Open Formats</h2>
			<ul style="display: inline-block">
				<li>PNG, JPEG (imaging)</li>
				<li>HTML, CSS (web development)</li>
				<li>ePub (e-book)</li>
				<li>XML (metadata)</li>
			</ul>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h2>Open Source</h2>
			<p>Although these examples demonstrate the value of open access, open standards, open formats, and open systems, in this course, we will primarily focus on open design&mdash;hardware schematics and software code&mdash;and its most important component: open source software.</p>

			<h2>Software Explained</h2>
			<p>In order to understand the significance of open source software, it is necessary to understand what software is. Software is nothing more than words written as commands in a collection of text files. These words constitute the software's &ldquo;source code.&rdquo; Before distributing the software, developers convert (i.e., compile) the words into &ldquo;microcode&rdquo; which the computer can understand and execute but is not human-readable. This prevents end-users from viewing and modifying the source code.</p>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h2>In the Beginning</h2>
			<p>When computers were still new, developers shared source code freely. This may have been, in part, the result of software being developed for a single type of computer, so no application could achieve wide adoption. In time, developers began to write more complicated programs that could run on multiple different types of computers, similarly to the circumstances of today. As a result, developers wanted to receive compensation for their effort and stopped sharing code.</p>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h2>The Free Software Movement</h2>
			<p>In 1979, Richard Stallman worked for MIT, and his department had a Xerox laser printer that would jam. The programmers in the department could have created a program that would have the printer report a jam, but they had no access to the printer's source code. One academic at another university had received a copy of the printer's source code from Xerox but was under a non-disclosure agreement not to share it.</p>
			<p>In order to combat the power of software vendors and recreate the earlier environment of shared software, Richard Stallman established the Free Software Foundation (FSF) to support the development of software in which the source code was freely shared.</p>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h2>Four Freedoms</h2>
			<p>Richard Stallman identified four essential freedoms:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>The freedom to run the program as you wish, for any purpose (freedom 0)</li>
				<li>The freedom to study how the program works, and change it so it does your computing as you wish (freedom 1)</li>
				<li>The freedom to redistribute copies so you can help your neighbor (freedom 2)</li>
				<li>The freedom to distribute copies of your modified versions to others (freedom 3)</li>
			</ul>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h2>Still a License</h2>
			<p>In 1989, Richard Stallman introduced the GNU General Public License (GPL) for releasing open source software. It may seem odd that an opponent of proprietary software licenses should choose to introduce a software license of his own. However, it turns out that this action makes sense. In the absence of a license, the creator's only options are either to disallow any third-party use or to place the creation in the public domain and give up all rights to it. The open source license allows the creator to retain rights while simultaneously leaving the creation freely available. Since that time, additional groups have released alternative open source licenses each with a different interpretation of what constitutes &ldquo;free.&rdquo;</p>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h2>Coming Together</h2>
			<p>One of the benefits of software licenses that allow users to view and modify the source code is that these users can also contribute their ideas back to the original project. In fact, the GPL requires that any modifications to a GPL-licensed program also be released under the same license, so that all subsequent derivatives are just as freely available as the original software. This openness allows for the voluntary creation of teams that join together to contribute to projects about which they feel passionate.</p>
		</section>

			<h2>Prominent Open Source Projects</h2>
			<ul style="display: inline-block">
				<li>Android (mobile operating system)</li>
				<li>Bitcoin (digital currency)</li>
				<li>R (data analysis tool)</li>
				<li>MySQL (database)</li>
			</ul>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h2>Taking Advantage</h2>
			<p>Many open source projects have become popular software tools. Additionally, many popular proprietary software packages contain open source code. This is one example of the potential for innovation that open source provides. These are some widely adopted proprietary software choices that contain open source code:</p>
			<ul style="display: inline-block">
				<li>Microsoft Windows</li>
				<li>Mac OS X</li>
				<li>iOS</li>
				<li>Google Chrome</li>
				<li>Safari</li>
			</ul>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h2>Products &ne; Solutions</h2>
			<p>Despite the significance of open source software, many end-users are unaware of it or not interested in considering it. One reason for this is that users frequently (erroneously) equate products with solutions, and once they find a product to satisfy a solution, all subsequent comparisons are against the pre-selected product, not the desired solution. For example, Microsoft Excel is a product, and individuals use it for many appropriate and inappropriate solutions: storage, analysis, visualization, etc. The search for an open source alternative to Excel leads to a comparison of the features in Excel and its competitor. The more important question would be whether an open source alternative exists for a specific solution, such as data storage, which leads to the more relevant comparison of the two products' ability to satisfy that solution.</p>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h2>Innovation</h2>
			<blockquote>Open source isn't a company or a product. It's a way of innovating and collaborating. It's so much more than being an open source company. We really leverage a huge community outside of ourselves to make sure what is being built in the market is what the customers need and what consumers want. The speed of innovation, as a result, is what we're seeing now.<br>&ndash; Dirk-Peter van Leeuwen, Red Hat</blockquote>

			<h2>Gratis versus Libre</h2>
			<p>Freely available generally means free as in freedom (libre: with little or no restriction) <em>not</em> as in beer (gratis: for zero price). These freedoms allow for inspection, modification, reuse, redistribution, etc. Although the creators of open content frequently also make their creations available at no cost, this is not a requirement in order for the content to qualify as open. (Open access is an exception to this because it requires no-cost access.)</p>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h2>Accounting Tie-in</h2>
			<p>98% of firms use open source software in their information systems. As a result, accountants' ability to participate in systems design relies on their knowledge of open source offerings and how they can support the organization's informational needs. Additionally, because open source software is governed by licenses, accounting architects must be aware of and monitor license requirements in order to maintain regulatory compliance.</p>
			<p>The accounting profession has also begun to embrace open content. As an alternative to paper or PDF financial statements, eXtensible Business Reporting Language (XBRL) is an open standard based on XML that allows preparers to apply metadata to their financials to improve usability of financial reports.</p>
