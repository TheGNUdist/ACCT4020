      <h2>Accounting Architecture</h2>

          <p>Sound information is the goal of an information system, and the Information section of the accounting architecture model lists the activities necessary to obtain the right data and convert it into the right information. Much of that data is traditional business data, but recently, information systems have increasingly focused on Big Data. The best information systems are flexible enough to support the creation, maintenance, and use of both types of data for the benefit of internal and external decision makers.</p>
        </div>

    <section>
      <h2>Accounting for Data</h2>
      <p>The ability to convert data into information has always been the primary focus of the accounting profession. Textbooks often refer to this role as &ldquo;measuring and reporting on economic events.&rdquo; Introductory financial accounting courses represent this task as involving (1) identification of the affected accounts, (2) determination of the effect on the accounting identity, (3) recording of the journal entry, (4) posting to the respective ledger accounts, (5) preparation of the trial balance, and (6) drafting of the financial statements. Other courses focus less on the process and more on the calculation of formulae or the application of regulatory standards to derive individual accounting numbers or to prepare forms and filings.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Not the Whole Story</h2>
      <p>The process of measuring and reporting on economic events as described by accounting courses is, however, incomplete. It is important for accountants, as information custodians, to have a more comprehensive view of how business data becomes business information and reports. This includes understanding the path of information creation as it progresses from the acquisition of data until it becomes information, and on until it reaches the end of its useful life and is destroyed or deleted.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Set an Example</h2>
      <p>An easy way to illustrate the need for greater understanding of the information system and its life cycle model is to pose the following question. Before step 1 in the accounting information process, the identification of affected accounts, where does the information come from? A genie does not appear to tell you that a transaction occurred. Similarly, consider the jump that must occur between step 5, preparation of the trial balance, and step 6, drafting of the financial statements. A journal or ledger entry doesn’t magically transform, becoming a financial statement; the financial statement is information that is created during the information life cycle. Understanding the information life cycle model permits greater understanding of the accounting information itself.</p>
    </section>

      <h2>Long, Long Ago</h2>
      <p>100 years ago, the management of documents and records in businesses and governments was typically a matter of chance and secretaries. Then came Emmet J. Leahy, a former military man hired by the U.S. Federal Government to get a handle on their out-of-control document storage. The goal was to find all the records in all the basements, attics, and filing cabinets and then decide what to do with them. Emmet J. Leahy envisioned a better way for the future: a system to manage records and documents that would be in place <u><em>before the document or record was created</em></u>, guiding the use and storage of documents from creation to destruction. Leahy created the analog predecessor to the information life cycle model that helps govern digital information systems.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>The Modern Information Life Cycle</h2>
      <p>The ILC is <strong>not</strong> a component of an information system; rather it models the roles that the components play. As you learn of specific technologies it will be helpful to revisit the ILC to understand how they fit in the system.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>This Is Important</h2>
      <p>Don’t let the arrow shapes in the information life cycle fool you. A successful information system is not a road that leads neatly from one place to the next in a specific order, although some tasks, of necessity, occur before others. Consider the information system instead as a blueprint, displaying all the details of a system’s structure from start to finish. Ideally, a successful information system should be complete in its design before any data is stored within it. The remainder of this lecture details the steps in each phase and their purposes.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Creation Phase: Needs Assessment</h2>
      <p><u><em>Needs Assessment</em></u> is the step that describes activities which help determine the information, the skills, and the internal processes required to successfully meet the objectives of an organization.</p>
      <p>Conducting a needs assessment is very simple but vitally important.</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Evaluate the current information, skills, and processes in place.</li>
        <li>Determine what the organization requires to meet its objectives.</li>
        <li>Compare the results of the first two steps to demonstrate which information, skills, or internal processes need to be added and which can be removed.</li>
      </ol>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Creation Phase: Acquisition</h2>
      <p><u><em>Acquistion</em></u> is the act of obtaining data or information, either from external sources or from previously owned data (e.g. internal reports) to enter into your system. This is the first time an organization will touch an information object, but it is not the point at which the object is ready to enter the information system. If this is confusing, consider a library or a retail store: an object that has been acquired is not ready for the shelves without additional processing steps.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Creation Phase: Classification</h2>
      <p><u><em>Classification</em></u> is the act of assigning attributes which describe an item. The purpose of classification is to improve findability. The classification terms are called metadata.</p>
      <p><u><em>Metadata</em></u> is literally &ldquo;data about data.&rdquo; It is data that describes an information object, such as a data point or a document. It is the only useful way to capture the context of a resource and the processes defining its use. Without its metadata, a document or data point has no meaning or relevance. The purpose of metadata is to describe; this in turn makes it easier to find and retrieve an object or data item and understand it.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Flying Monkeys</h2>
      <p>Whenever my son, who is in the fifth grade, answers a math question by writing a number without noting the unit of measurement, his teacher assumes that his “2” means “2 flying monkeys”. A silly example, but without the metadata describing that this number is a measurement of cubic feet, “2” as an answer is meaningless. The same applies to an accounting transaction. 42,589 means nothing unless we can associate it with the appropriate metadata indicating that it is a debit on a specific account on a certain date.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Metdata Makes Life Worth Living</h2>
      <p>Metadata is the most important concept to understand from the information life cycle. Metadata, as it is assigned to an information object, has two paired components. The metadata <u><em>attribute</em></u> gives the context of the characteristic being described, while the <u><em>value</em></u> delineates the object-specific description itself. Keep in mind that a collection of metadata attributes and their values should be sufficient to identify any individual information object.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>If You Forget Everything Else</h2>
      <p>You need to remember metadata. It is the way that documents and other information objects are described and understood, and accurate metadata absolutely must be in place in order to find information later as well as analyze it properly. You unknowingly interact with metadata every day. Google search engines read web page and image metadata in order to return results, a library catalog searches metadata records to find relevant books and articles, and metadata is how your file browser knows which files were created when and by whom. If metadata is missing or wrong, our understanding is impaired and finding the item later can be impossible.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>ATTRIBUTE : value</h2>
      <p>The attribute is the aspect of an object that is being described, or the characteristic in general such as TITLE or CREATOR. The value is the specific description for the object in question such as Jaws or William Shakespeare. The following example is a portion of the metadata for an item in Dr. Coyne’s personal library.</p>
      <ul style="list-style-type: none; display: inline-block">
        <li>(ATTRIBUTE) : (value)</li>
        <li>OBJECT TYPE : hardcover book</li>
        <li>TITLE : The Open Organization</li>
        <li>AUTHOR : Jim Whitehurst</li>
        <li>YEAR OF PUBLICATION : 2015</li>
        <li>PUBLISHER : Harvard Business Review Press</li>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>A Question of Formatting</h2>
      <p><u><em>eXtensible Markup Language</em></u> (XML) is used to annotate documents and text. It is widely used to “mark up” texts and documents on the internet. Metadata is frequently stored in XML format. The &lt;tag&gt; corresponds to the ATTRIBUTE; the text between the open &lt;tag&gt; and the close &lt;/tag&gt; is the value. It follows the following formula: <strong>&lt;attribute&gt;value&lt;/attribute&gt;</strong> Here is the prior example in XML format.</p>
      <ul style="list-style-type: none; display: inline block">
        <li>&lt;?xml version=&ldquo;1.0&rdquo; encoding=&ldquo;UTF-8&rdquo;?></li>
        <li>&lt;metadata&gt;
          <ul style="list-style-type: none">
            <li>&lt;title&gt;The Open Organization&lt;/title&gt;</li>

          &lt;/metadata&gt;
        </li>
      </ul>

    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Creation Phase: Conversion and Ingestion</h2>
      <p><u><em>Conversion</em></u> is the transformation of data from its current format to a more desirable format for the purposes of storage. This might be done to promote uniformity, or to comply with the access technology that is already in use in the information system. Scanning a document to create a PDF is one example.</p>
      <p><u><em>Ingestion</em></u> is the process through which the prepared information is entered into the organization’s storage. Data entry can be automated or done by humans. It is additionally categorized as either “continuous” or “batch”. When done continuously it is resource-intensive, but the information is available immediately. When it is delayed and then executed in batches (i.e. groups) it is more efficient, but this should be restricted to data that is not needed immediately.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Maintenance Phase: Storage</h2>
      <p><u><em>Storage</em></u> is the action as well as the method of storing something for future use. The principles of storage are straightforward and unchanging, regardless of the format of the object being stored. The primary key to successful storage is choosing the appropriate medium in which to store it. Considerations include such things as the length of time it needs to be stored, the desired level of accessibility, and how much you anticipate needing to add to the storage in the future. You cannot store a horse underneath your bed, nor should you store large files marked for permanent retention on cheaply made thumb drives.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>You Cannot Store Everything</h2>
      <p><blockquote>There’s a temptation to think that you’re just going to store everything. First, that’s a fool’s errand because it will break the bank. Yes, storage is getting cheaper, but it’s not getting cheaper as fast as we’re getting more data. And second, it just doesn’t make good business sense. Your need for all that data varies with time.<br>&ndash; Jeffrey Crigler, CTO, Catalist</blockquote></p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Maintenance Phase: Indexing</h2>
      <p>If you have ever used a table of contents or an index in a book, you can understand <u><em>indexing</em></u>: the creation of a finding aid (i.e. index) to facilitate quick retrieval of objects. Completing a full search of the contents of a database every time a search is completed is resource-intensive and wastes time. Instead, a search can look for a reference to the requested item in an index. That reference in the index then points to the actual item’s location. Every index, digital or otherwise, works with these <u><em>keys</em></u> and <u><em>pointers</em></u>. As an example, the alphabetized term in an index is the key, while the page number it directs you to is a pointer. Indexing is not a requirement in order to perform a search, but the creation of an index can save valuable time as well as computing resources.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Maintenance Phase: Refreshing and Interpretation</h2>
      <p><u><em>Refreshing</em></u> is the updating of data stores to ensure that data and metadata are current and up-to-date. It is also used as a preservation process to prevent data loss over time by creating fresh but still identical copies of information.</p>
      <p><u><em>Interpretation</em></u> is the selection and preservation of hardware and software that are necessary to “read” digital information, presenting it in both human- and computer-readable formats. Software and hardware frequently change. Floppy discs won’t fit in CD drives. Outdated file formats can’t be opened by incompatible software programs. Laser discs are only useful if one has access to a working laser disc player to interpret the information on the discs.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Maintenance Phase: Disposition</h2>
      <p>The decision point where an organization decides when and how an information object will leave the information system is known as <u><em>disposition</em></u>. Items marked for retention are moved to long term storage. Licensed items might be returned to the owner. Useless information is scheduled for deletion, sensitive items are destroyed, and valuable items may be transferred or sold to another organization. These decisions should never be made on a case-by-case basis, but instead should be in accordance with <u><em>disposition schedules</em></u>, an organization's specific guidelines for disposing of information at the end of its useful life.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Use Phase: Searching</h2>
      <p>The Use section of the architecture is the apex of the arch, and it represents the goals of the entire information system: accessing and using the data in the system to create valuable information for organizational stakeholders. <u><em>Searching</em></u> is the act of looking for something; in a digital information system this is done through <u><em>queries</em></u>, or search commands. When searching is executed properly it allows the information system to do what it is designed to do, allowing an organization to access its resources. Before a user can perform an efficient query, the objects in the system need classification with metadata during the creation phase. Lastly, it’s helpful to note that searches are most effective when performed by persons trained in effective search techniques.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Use Phase: Analytics</h2>
      <p><u><em>Analytics</em></u> is a popular buzzword, but it is simply the process of using business data to make informed decisions and gain additional insights about that business. The terms <u><em>business intelligence</em></u> and <u><em>business analytics</em></u> are used interchangeably, and are newer concepts that are loosely defined as the skills, tools, technologies, and techniques used to gather and understand data to make informed business decisions. The specific data analysis tools you use in your profession will largely depend on your employer’s preferences and the information with which you are working.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Use Phase: Reporting</h2>
      <p><u><em>Reporting</em></u> is a familiar concept. Many of the reports created by accountants are driven by regulation compliance. It follows that these reports by law must contain accurate information. Various reports may be generated for clients, marketing, or other outside entities as well. However, the most important consumers of reports are internal decision makers. These decision makers use business data from the information system to make strategic decisions for the firm. All of these reports rely on accurate business data.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Show Me Something</h2>
      <p>A creative, popular, and increasingly effective way of communicating the results from the analytics step of both life cycles is the <u><em>visualization</em></u>. Of all the human senses, vision is processed by the brain the fastest. This means that a strong visual representation can convey more information faster than any other method. In addition, the human visual faculties can be very good at distinguishing patterns and differences, an advantage that can be used wisely when preparing reports and creating graphs, tables, or infographics.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Would I Lie To You?</h2>
      <p>Visualizations are powerful tools, and when using them it is important to strive to tell the truth with integrity. It is not difficult to manipulate the graphics in a visualization to distort or exaggerate the effect in the data. Do not ever allow this; decision makers rely on accurate representations of business data. Strategic planning that is based on inaccurate ideas of what the business data indicates is dangerous.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>What About Big Data?</h2>
      <p><u><e>Big Data</em></u> is the bandwagon every firm is trying to jump on in this decade. Three characteristics distinguish Big Data from regular data. <u><em>Volume</em></u>, the reason Big Data is referred to as &ldquo;Big&rdquo; connotes the large amounts of data businesses receive from transactions, machine communication, and social media interactions. <u><em>Velocity</em></u> references the high rate at which these large amounts of data are created and processed. <u><em>Variety</em></u> describes the lack of uniformity in data sources containing text, audio, video, image, and other data types. Each of these characteristics present challenges that require new approaches.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Risky Business</h2>
      <p>Big Data, when used wisely, offers firms the opportunity to improve knowledge discovery, solve problems, offer superior customer service, and increase profits. However, Big Data is not always accurate, reliable, or ethical to use. There are definitely risks to overemphasizing the importance of Big Data. Allocating storage to preserve useless data costs money. Analyzing data for the sake of itself wastes staff time and resources. Basing business decisions on inaccurate information can cause significant damage to a company’s profits and reputations. Each of these has a cost, without providing sufficient organizational value in exchange. Big Data, like all information, should be used to contribute to an organization’s goals.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Big Data Life Cycle</h2>
      <p>The five steps presented in bold italics are steps that apply only to Big Data, and they replace steps in the ILC. Steps with an asterisk share a name with an ILC step, but manifest differently to accommodate the unique nature of Big Data.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>BDLC vs. ILC: Creation Phase</h2>
      <p>When examining Big Data, a needs assessment differs from the traditional ILC in one significant way: the volume of data makes it difficult to ascertain exactly which data items will be useful. Instead, the data sources (i.e. pools) which are most likely to provide useful data are identified. Then, instead of acquiring only what is needed, Collection involves gathering all of the data from those previously identified pools. Sifting is the evaluative process that follows; data that has been collected is examined and unnecessary data is deleted. This alleviates the need to process data that will only prove useless later on. Lastly, synchronization pairs or correlates this Big Data with existing business data.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>BDLC vs. ILC: Maintenance Phase</h2>
      <p>The changes in Storage are some of the most significant because the underlying technology is very different. Big Data’s volume and variety make it ill-suited to traditional storage technologies, and a variety of creative data stores have been developed to address these issues.</p>
      <p>Pre-processing replaces indexing as a means of transforming data into more usable information. Cleaning and manipulation, which must be completed before data analysis, occur during this step. This includes removing duplicates, checking for integrity violations, filtering, sorting, and grouping appropriate data together. Not all data, however, is subject to pre-processing.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>BDLC vs. ILC: Use Phase</h2>
      <p>Monitoring replaces searching in the Use phase of the Big Data life cycle. Although real-time analytics is on the rise, manual searching of Big Data remains rare. Automated monitoring of trends and outliers is more common. One reason for this is that unlike traditional business and accounting data, managers will frequently not know what story Big Data tells or even what to look for. Monitoring can find the message hidden within Big Data. These differences affect Analytics in a similar fashion.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>The Long and the Short</h2>
      <p>In looking at an information system of any kind, it’s best if you can see the end from the beginning; remember the concept of the blueprint. All of those steps within the ILC should be used to guide your system to meet your organization’s needs, the primary of which is usefulness. Data needs to be findable, accessible, understandable, and usable. Without understanding the information system, accountants can only hope that accurate data makes it into the hands of decision makers. With a complete view, accountants can facilitate the reporting of complete and accurate information. Lastly, don’t be intimidated by the sheer amount of data out there. The pursuit of knowledge should be the goal, not the pursuit of more data.</p>
