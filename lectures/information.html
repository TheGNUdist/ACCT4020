      <h2>Accounting Architecture</h2>

        <div class="flex-item" style="max-width: 70%">
          <p>Sound information is the goal of an information system, and the Information section of the accounting architecture model lists the activities necessary to obtain the right data and convert it into the right information. Much of that data is traditional business data, but recently, information systems have increasingly focused on Big Data. The best information systems are flexible enough to support the creation, maintenance, and use of both types of data for the benefit of internal and external decision makers.</p>
        </div>
      </div>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Accounting for Data</h2>
      <p>The ability to convert data into information has always been the primary focus of the accounting profession. Textbooks often refer to this role as &ldquo;measuring and reporting on economic events.&rdquo; Introductory financial accounting courses represent this task as involving (1) identification of the affected accounts, (2) determination of the effect on the accounting identity, (3) recording of the journal entry, (4) posting to the respective ledger accounts, (5) preparation of the trial balance, and (6) drafting of the financial statements. Other courses focus less on the process and more on the calculation of formulae or the application of regulatory standards to derive individual accounting numbers or to prepare forms and filings.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Data Sources</h2>
      <p>However, the steps in measuring and reporting on economic events as described by accounting courses is incomplete and leaves a number of questions unanswered. For example, how should accountants acquire enough data to know which accounts are affected by a transaction? How should they learn about the economic event in the first place? The generally accepted answer to these questions is to use <u><em>source documents</em></u>. These are the physical or digital documents that initiate and provide evidence of a transaction, such as a sales order or a check stub from a customer or an invoice from a vendor. With these documents, accountants can identify which accounts are affected by a particular transaction (e.g., cash and accounts payable for a vendor invoice).</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Not in the Beginning</h2>
      <p>Unfortunately, the importance of source documents merely serves to raise four more questions: How will these source documents be generated? How can businesses guarantee that all transactions have a source document? How can accountants be sure to receive all source documents? How can businesses ensure that source documents contain all relevant data for accountants? These questions are not evidence that source documents are not useful, rather they clearly prove that measuring and reporting begins before the receipt of a source document. Source documents will not magically come into existence and then into the possession of an accountant. Additional action is necessary in order to ensure that accountants have the data that they need in order to conduct measurement and reporting activities.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Not the Middle or the End, Either</h2>
      <p>The problem with the six-step reporting procedure is not only the incorrect identification of the first step. The procedure leaves questions open about the middle and the end, as well. How are journal entries or ledger posts stored, classified, and subsequently retrieved in order to generate financial statements? Since journal entries and ledger balances are not the only financial statement inputs, how are all other necessary inputs identified and gathered in order to create financial statements? Financial statements are not the only accounting report, so what other reports are necessary, and how are they generated and communicated to stakeholders and decision makers? What happens to accounting data once these reports have been generated?</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Data &ne; Presentation</h2>
      <p>An additional issue with this traditional, six-step procedure is the potential for a confound between data itself and the presentation of that data. For example, a journal is a series of accounts with their associated debit or credit adjustments sorted by date, and a ledger is that same list of accounts with their associated debits and credits sorted by account. They are simply two presentations of the same data, and in the case of digital data it would not be wise to store this data twice for the sole purpose of having the data presented in two different ways. Data is the measurement of economic activities. Presentation is driven by the type of desired report or visualization. Financial statements are one kind of visualization, but the same financial data can be used in other presentations, as well.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>The Responsible Way</h2>
      <p>With so many questions regarding measurement and recording left unanswered, accountants must make a choice. They can either assume that some other business function will provide them with all necessary data and instructions in order to measure and report successfully or assume the responsibility of information custodian and become self-reliant. This self-reliance necessitates the identification of an alternative, more complete series of tasks to implement in order to acquire important business data and convert it into valuable business information and reports. Fortunately, the information sciences discipline has developed just such a series: the <u><em>information life cycle</em></u> (ILC). The ILC explains how to know what data to collect, how to collect it, how to use it to create information, and what to do with the data after it has outlived its usefulness.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>How Did We Get Here?</h2>
      <p>In 1947, the U.S. Government formed the Government Records Management Task Force to deal with the approximately 50 billion sheets of paper (18.5 million cubic feet or six Pentagons) stored in over 100 records centers costing over $1.2 billion per year. The task force determined that 50% of these documents could be immediately eliminated and that only 4% had any obvious value. In order to prevent this situation from arising again, the head of this task force, Emmet J. Leahy, designed the first information life cycle model. This life cycle determined the ideal system for managing documents consistently, effectively, and efficiently from creation, through storage, to their ultimate destruction, which could be put in place before any document was created. This same principle guides digital information systems today.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>The Modern Information Life Cycle</h2>
      <div class="override"><img src="../images/ilc.png" alt="Information Life Cycle" style="max-height: 250px"/></div>
      <p>The modern-day ILC explains what an information system should do. The ILC contains 13 steps grouped into three phases. The <u><em>Creation</em></u> phase includes the steps necessary to bring data into the information system. The <u><em>Maintenance</em></u> phase contains the steps to ensure that data is findable when needed. The <u><em>Use</em></u> phase comprises the steps to convert data into information.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>You Must Remember This...</h2>
      <p>The arrow shapes in the ILC graphic seem to imply an order of events. Although certain life cycle steps precede others, the ILC is less of a roadmap or a set of directions and more of a blueprint. This has two implications. First, the steps in the ILC may not be in the same order at all times for all types of data. Second, and more importantly, an information system should be completely designed, according to the guidelines in this blueprint, before attempting to acquire any data. The Technology section of the accounting architecture model highlights the technologies that make up the information system, and they serve to implement the ILC. As a result, when selecting information technologies, it is important to keep in mind which tasks in the ILC the technology will help to accomplish.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Creation Phase: Needs Assessment</h2>
      <p>The first step in the ILC is the <u><em>needs assessment</em></u>. This step is first because it identifies the informational needs of internal and external stakeholders that the information system should satisfy. The understanding is necessary in order to design a useful information system. Conducting a needs assessment is very simple but vitally important:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Evaluate the current information, skills, and processes in place.</li>
        <li>Determine what information the organization requires in order to meet its objectives.</li>
        <li>Compare the results of the first two steps to demonstrate which information, skills, or processes need to be added and which can be removed.</li>
      </ol>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Which Came First?</h2>
      <p>Needs assessment is unique among the steps in the ILC because it is the only planning task. The remainder of the steps in the life cycle are the tasks in converting data into information. This can create confusion regarding the order of events. First, the needs assessment determines what information the information system should generate. Second, IT and business specialists collaborate to design a system that will successfully implement the remaining steps in the ILC to bring necessary information to decision makers. Third, the completed information system leads data through the steps in the information life cycle to generate business information and reports. Fourth, as necessary, a new needs assessment is conducted in order to discover the need for modifications to the information system.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Creation Phase: Acquisition</h2>
      <p><u><em>Acquisition</em></u> is the first step in the ILC that occurs after the design and implementation of the information system, and it is also the first step that directly affects business data. Acquisition is the act of obtaining data, either from external sources (e.g., source documents) or from previously owned data (e.g., internal reports) to enter into your system. Although this step is the first time an organization will handle a data object, it is not the point at which that object is ready to enter the information system. A retail store provides a useful analogy for understanding the difference in timing between data acquisition and data entry into a system: an inventory item that has been acquired is not ready for the shelves without additional processing steps.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Creation Phase: Classification</h2>
      <p>The first processing step prior to data entry is <u><em>classification</em></u>, which is the act of assigning descriptive attributes to a data item. These descriptives attributes are called <u><em>metadata</em></u>. Metadata is literally data about data. It is what the data, be it a single number or an entire document, means. Units are a simple example of metadata. the number 1,000 on a financial statement could be dollars, thousands of dollars, or even millions of dollars. Each of these units gives the number 1,000 a different meaning. Similarly, when measuring distances, the number 1,000 could be centimeters, feet, or miles. Each of these lengths gives the number 1,000 a different meaning that is also very different from 1,000 dollars. Units of measurement are a form of metadata that gives a number a particular meaning. Without units, the number 1,000 has no meaning.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Metadata Gives Life Meaning</h2>
      <p>The importance of metadata for lending meaning extends beyond single numbers to entire documents or files. If a radio studio had 10,000 songs with incremented file names (i.e., 0000.mp3, 0001.mp3, 0002.mp3, etc.), how would the DJ know which song to choose? Put differently, what is the meaning of 0145.mp3? Meaning in this case could be song title, artist, album, and year, but without metadata a DJ would not know that 0145.mp3 means Bohemian Rhapsody by Queen on A Night at the Opera from 1975. In order to find the track with that meaning, the DJ would need to listen to each file in order to find the correct one. In a set of 10,000 files, listening to each in order to find a specific one would make for a lousy radio station. However, with the proper metadata to give the files meaning, the DJ can always retrieve the correct song.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>ATTRIBUTE : value</h2>
      <p>Metadata relies on pairs of <u><em>attributes</em></u> and <u><em>values</em></u>. An attribute is a characteristic of a data object. Each attribute takes on a different value for each data object. For example, a book may have the attributes title, author, year, and publisher, and a specific book would have the following attribute-value pairs:</p>
      <ul style="list-style-type: none; display: inline-block">
        <li>(ATTRIBUTE) : (value)</li>
        <li>TITLE : The Open Organization</li>
        <li>AUTHOR : Jim Whitehurst</li>
        <li>YEAR : 2015</li>
        <li>PUBLISHER : Harvard Business Review Press</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>A Question of Formatting</h2>
      <p><u><em>eXtensible Markup Language</em></u> (XML) is a popular convention for formatting metadata using tags. The &lt;tag&gt; corresponds to the attribute, and the text between the open &lt;tag&gt; and the close &lt;/tag&gt; is the value, such that XML reads &lt;attribute&gt;value&lt;/attribute&gt;. The same book listed previously would have the following XML-formatted metadata:</p>
      <ul style="list-style-type: none; display: inline-block">
        <li>&lt;metadata&gt;
          <ul style="list-style-type: none">
            <li>&lt;title&gt;The Open Organization&lt;/title&gt;</li>
            <li>&lt;creator&gt;Jim Whitehurst&lt;/creator&gt;</li>
            <li>&lt;year&gt;2015&lt;/year&gt;</li>
            <li>&lt;publisher&gt;Harvard Business Review Press&lt;/publisher&gt;</li>
          </ul>
          &lt;/metadata&gt;
        </li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Financial Statement Metadata</h2>
      <p><u><em>eXtensible Business Reporting Language</em></u> (XBRL) is an XML-based metadata framework for financial reporting data. Since 2009, the SEC has mandated the use of XBRL for public company financial statements. A primary purpose of XBRL is to improve the findability of individual numbers in corporate filings by giving those numbers direct meaning (i.e., metadata). The metadata attribute lists the account name (e.g., AccountsPayableCurrent) and the value is the balance of that account. This tagging system allows users to interpret numbers directly, instead of requiring readers to interpret them from their table or footnote disclosure. This also increases computer-readability of financial reports making it easier to analyze data for large collections of financial statements and to compare financial data across companies.</p>

      </ul>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Creation Phase: Conversion and Ingestion</h2>
      <p><u><em>Conversion</em></u> is the transformation of data from its current format to a more desirable format for the purposes of storage. This might be done to promote uniformity or to conform the data to the technology that is already in use in the information system. Scanning a document to create a PDF is one example.</p>
      <p>The final step in the Creation phase is  <u><em>ingestion</em></u>, which is when data enters the information system. Data entry can be manual or automated and <u><em>continuous</em></u> or <u><em>batch</em></u>. Continuous ingestion is a greater burden on information system resources, but it makes data available immediately. Batch ingestion uses resources more efficiently by entering data in groups (i.e., batches) when information system resources are not needed by other functions (e.g., after work hours).</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Who Needs What When?</h2>
      <p>Although continuous data entry is more resource-intensive than batch entry, it is necessary when a business entity must respond immediately to the data. For example, sales orders require continuous ingestion so that sales people can fill customer orders as soon as possible. On the other hand, the ingestion of employee time cards can be in batches because the generation of paychecks and pay stubs will rarely immediately follow the receipt of a time card. However, neither of these examples is necessarily true in all cases. For example, sales orders may be suited to batch ingestion if the finished good takes a long time to complete (e.g., a house). A needs assessment should identify which data needs continuous ingestion and which data can wait for batch ingestion.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Maintenance Phase: Storage</h2>
      <p><u><em>Storage</em></u> is both the act of storing physical and digital data, as well as the method of storing that data, for future use. The principles of storage are straightforward and unchanging. One key to successful storage is choosing the appropriate medium for each data object. Considerations include the length of time the data should be stored, desired ease of access to the data, and expected future increases (i.e., scalability) in storage needs. Here again, a needs assessment will discover what medium is appropriate for which data. It is not feasible to store a horse underneath a bed, nor is it wise to store large files marked for permanent retention on cheaply made thumb drives.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>You Cannot Store Everything</h2>
      <p>Another key to successful storage is identifying what data is important enough to store in the first place. The world is full of data, and storing more than is absolutely necessary increases costs and makes necessary data less findable and usable.</p>
      <blockquote>There's a temptation to think that you're just going to store everything. First, that's a fool's errand because it will break the bank. Yes, storage is getting cheaper, but it's not getting cheaper as fast as we're getting more data. And second, it just doesn't make good business sense.<br>&ndash; Jeffrey Crigler, CTO, Catalist</blockquote>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Maintenance Phase: Indexing</h2>
      <p>The goal of the classification and storage steps is to make the right data retrievable when needed. <u><em>Indexing</em></u> increases findability by creating an additional data store of <u><em>keys</em></u> and <u><em>pointers</em></u>. An index is a store of metadata. The metadata attribute identifies the type of index, the metadata value is the key, and the pointer identifies the location of the data object the metadata describes. A library catalog of book titles, a keyword index in the back of a textbook, or a list of song titles in a playlist are all examples of indexes. Looking for a key in an index and then following the pointer to the data object is faster than searching through an entire data store for the desired data item. This is true when performing a manual search or an automated search with queries. Indexing can save valuable time, as well as computing resources when data is needed.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Maintenance Phase: Refreshing and Interpretation</h2>
      <p><u><em>Refreshing</em></u> updates data stores to ensure that data and metadata are current and up-to-date. Refreshing also preserves data from corruption over time by creating fresh but still identical copies of stored data.</p>
      <p><u><em>Interpretation</em></u> is the selection and preservation of hardware and software necessary to access data from digital data stores. Software and hardware frequently change, and the selection of storage technologies will not guarantee data accessibility permanently. For example, floppy discs won't fit in CD drives. Laser discs are only useful with access to a working laser disc player. Microsoft Access files require the Microsoft Access software.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Use Phase: Searching</h2>
      <p>The Use phase is the culmination of the ILC, and it is also the apex of the accounting architecture model. It represents the goal of the entire information system: retrieving and using data to create valuable information for organizational stakeholders. Effective data retrieval is the bridge between data storage and data analytics. Stored data is only useful if it is retrievable; irretrievable data may just as well not exist. Metadata is a primary requirement for data retrievability. Data retrieval and use begin with <u><em>searching</em></u> to find data in storage. Searching for data in digital storage often involves the use of <u><em>queries</em></u>, which are search commands that request data based on certain characteristics (e.g., all payments from April 2017). Indexes aid in searching by linking data attributes to the data storage location.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Use Phase: Analytics</h2>
      <p><u><em>Analytics</em></u> is a popular buzzword, but it is simply the process of using data to gain insights and make informed business decisions. The terms <u><em>business intelligence</em></u> and <u><em>business analytics</em></u> or <u><em>data analytics</em></u> are used interchangeably. These newer concepts are loosely defined as the skills, tools, technologies, and techniques used to gather and understand data to make informed business decisions. In the current Information Era, the availability of larger amounts of data, as well as greater computing power needed to store, retrieve, and process that data, has made data analytics more valuable because it can answer previously unanswered, money-making questions. The best analytical tool will depend on the nature of the data and the type and urgency of the question, but in the current business climate, the ability to use at least one tool is a valuable skill.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Accounting Skills</h2>
      <p>Accounting firms want accountants with data analytics skills because data analytics improves compliance and assurance. Historically, internal and external auditors have reviewed a sample of transactions to conclude whether financial statement numbers are fairly represented and to look for the potential for fraud. More powerful analytical tools paired with increased storage capacity for financial transactions has created the opportunity for analyzing the entire population of transactions and not only a sample. This leads to greater assurance and greater ability to find fraud and error. Other accounting functions also benefit because they can use the analysis of population data to have increased assurance of the accuracy of financial reports.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Hot Topic</h2>
      <p>Beyond just public accounting firms, corporations all of kinds also desire analytical skills. The Information Era provides companies with more data than they can handle. Firms, such as Google and Facebook, have made billions of dollars without any physical assets to speak of because they have acquired data about consumer markets that they convert into various forms of business intelligence. Firms have paid for this data because they believe that it contains information that will increase their profitability. Likewise, firms have begun to collect similar data for themselves with the same goal in mind. The Information Era has taught us that the firm with the best information wins. However, more data only leads to better information in the hands of a skilled analyst.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Before Tools</h2>
      <p>Because data analytics is a hot topic, it is easy to forget that the solution to finding answers in data is not in identifying the right analytical tool. Tools are valuable, even vital, but they are not sufficient. Using software to analyze data is one part of data analytics, but the software will often only help to find well-defined answers to well-defined questions. Software is mostly useless without first knowing what you want to know. The ability to retrieve and analyze data begins with <u><em>understanding</em></u> and <u><em>judgment</em></u>&mdash;understanding of the data and the informational needs of stakeholders and sound judgment to consider the correct questions to ask and approach to take in order to find answers. Once an analyst has understanding and sound judgment, analytics software becomes a powerful tool to find valuable answers.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Use Phase: Reporting</h2>
      <p>The end goal of the entire ILC is to communicate information to stakeholders so that they can make strategic decisions. Many of the reports created by accountants are driven by regulation compliance (e.g., financial statements or tax forms). However, the most important consumers of reports are internal decision makers. As a result, even though this step in the ILC is called <u><em>reporting</em></u>, it comprises more than conventional reports, such as budget reports, financial statements, or audit reports. In today's business environment, much reporting is immediate in the form of <u><em>dashboards</em></u> or notifications. Dashboards provide stakeholders with a collection of graphs and figures that give up-to-date business statistics. Notifications or flags bring issues to a stakeholder's attention in order to prompt immediate action.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Show Me Something</h2>
      <p>Many reports, and especially dashboards, rely on <u><em>visualization</em></u> to communicate results. Of all the human senses, vision is processed by the brain the fastest. This means that a strong visual representation can convey more information faster than any other method. In addition, the human visual faculties can be very good at distinguishing patterns and differences, an advantage that can be used when preparing reports and creating graphs, tables, or infographics, which are compilations of visual representations of data to tell a story. Because visualizations are powerful reporting tools, when using them it is important to strive for integrity. It is not difficult to manipulate graphics in order to distort or exaggerate. However, strategic planning based on inaccurate information is detrimental.</p>

      <h2>Maintenance Phase: Disposition</h2>
      <p>The end goal of the ILC is reporting, but that is not the end of the data's life cycle. Once the data has outlived its usefulness, it faces <u><em>disposition</em></u>. Disposition is not necessarily deletion. Data that belongs to another organization might be returned to the owner. Internally generated data that other organizations find valuable might be transferred or sold. Useless data and sensitive data should be deleted or destroyed. Even permanent retention of data in long-term storage is a form of disposition. The method and timing of data disposition should always follow previously established <u><em>disposition schedules</em></u>, which are an organization's guidelines for data disposition at the end of its useful life.</p>

      <h2>What About Big Data?</h2>
      <p>The ILC explains how an information system should convert traditional business data into information. However, much data today is <u><em>Big Data</em></u>. Three characteristics distinguish Big Data from regular data. <u><em>Volume</em></u>, the reason Big Data is referred to as &ldquo;Big,&rdquo; connotes the large amounts of data businesses receive from transactions, machine communication, and social media interactions. <u><em>Velocity</em></u> references the high rate at which these large amounts of data are created and processed. <u><em>Variety</em></u> describes the lack of uniformity in data sources containing text, audio, video, image, and other data types. Each of these characteristics present challenges that require new approaches to the ILC.</p>

      <h2>Big Data Life Cycle</h2>
      <div class="override"><img src="../images/bdlc.png" alt="Big Data Life Cycle" style="max-height: 250px"/></div>
      <p>The <u><em>Big Data life cycle</em></u> (BDLC) comprises the steps to convert Big Data into useful business information. Much of this life cycle is the same as the ILC. The five steps in bold italics are steps that apply only to Big Data, and they replace steps in the ILC. Steps with an asterisk share a name with an ILC step but require different execution in the BDLC to accommodate the unique nature of Big Data.</p>

      <h2>BDLC vs. ILC: Creation Phase</h2>
      <p>When examining Big Data, a needs assessment differs from a traditional ILC needs assessment in one significant way: the volume of data makes it difficult to ascertain exactly which data items will be useful. Instead, data sources (i.e., pools) which are most likely to provide useful data are identified. Then, instead of acquiring only what is needed, <u><em>collection</em></u> involves gathering all of the data from those previously identified pools. <u><em>Sifting</em></u> is the evaluative process that follows; data that has been collected is examined and unnecessary data is deleted. This alleviates the need to process data that will only prove useless later on. Lastly, <u><em>synchronization</em></u> pairs or correlates this Big Data with existing traditional business data.</p>

      <h2>BDLC vs. ILC: Maintenance Phase</h2>
      <p>The changes in the storage step are some of the most significant because the underlying technology is very different. Big Data's volume and variety make it ill-suited to traditional storage technologies, and a variety of creative data stores have been developed to address these issues.</p>
      <p><u><em>Pre-processing</em></u> replaces indexing as a means of transforming Big Data into more usable data that is ready for analysis. Cleaning and manipulation, which must be completed before data analysis, occur during this step. This includes removing duplicate or unnecessary data, sorting data, and grouping appropriate data together.</p>

    <section>
      <h2>BDLC vs. ILC: Use Phase</h2>
      <p><u><em>Monitoring</em></u> replaces searching in the Use phase of the Big Data life cycle. One reason for continuous, automated monitoring of trends and outliers in Big Data is that unlike with traditional business data, managers will frequently not know what &ldquo;story&rdquo; Big Data tells or what questions to use data analytics to answer. Monitoring can help to discover the right questions to ask in order to find the message hidden within Big Data.</p>
      <p>The sheer volume, as well as variety, of Big Data also changes the selection of tools used for data analysis. This gives rise to the term <u><em>Big Data analytics</em></u>. These analytical tools often require much more time to process data. However, recent attempts to simplify and expedite Big Data analytics have caused a convergence in the types of tools available for both traditional and Big Data analytics.</p>

      <h2>(Big) Data Analytics</h2>
      <p>Currently, much of the desire for data analytics skills is related to the difficulty in finding answers in Big Data. As a result, some use the moniker &ldquo;Big Data analytics,&rdquo; but data analytics is not only for Big Data, especially in an accounting context. Traditional financial data is not Big Data, but data analytics improves the use of financial data for compliance and decision-making purposes. However, the analysis of Big Data should matter to accountants because both traditional financial data and Big Data are useful for decision making, and any data that has strategic implications is under the purview of accountants and accounting architects. As more firms look to Big Data for answers, accountants should increase the scope of their duties to encompass this wealth of potential information. Any data that supports stakeholders is the purview of accountants.</p>

      <h2>Risky Business</h2>
      <p>Big Data, when used wisely, offers entities the opportunity to improve knowledge discovery, solve problems, offer superior customer service, and increase profits. However, Big Data is not always accurate, reliable, or ethical to use. There are definitely risks to overemphasizing the importance of Big Data. Allocating storage to preserve useless data costs money. Analyzing data for the sake of itself wastes staff time and resources. Basing business decisions on inaccurate information can cause significant damage to a company's profits and reputations. Each of these has a cost without providing sufficient organizational value in exchange. Big Data, like all information, should only be used when it contributes to an organization's goals.</p>

      <h2>The Long and the Short</h2>
      <p>In considering the design and implementation of an information system, it is best to see the end from the beginning. Data needs to be findable, accessible, understandable, and usable. The ILC and BDLC provide blueprints that facilitate this perspective by explaining what a fully functional information system should do, and these life cycle steps guide the assessment of an organization's informational needs and the subsequent development of the system itself. Without this, accountants can only hope that accurate data and information make it into the hands of decision makers. On the other hand, with an understanding of these life cycles, accountants can actively participate in the custodianship of both traditional business data and Big Data and facilitate the reporting of complete and accurate information.</p>
