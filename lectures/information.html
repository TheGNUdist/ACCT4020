					<p>The Information section of the accounting architecture framework explains what a system should do. Information is the goal of any information system, and the Information section describes the steps necessary to get the right data and convert it into the right information. Much of that data is traditional busines data, but recently, information systems have increasingly focused on Big Data. The best information systems are flexible enough to support the creation, maintenance, and use of both types of data for the benefit of internal and external decision makers.</p>

			<h2>Accounting for Data</h2>
			<p>The ability to convert data into information has always been the primary focus of the accounting profession. Textbooks often refer to this role as &ldquo;measuring and reporting on economic events.&rdquo; Introductory financial accounting courses represent this task as involving (1) identification of the affected accounts, (2) determination of the effect on the accounting identity, (3) recording of the journal entry, (4) posting to the respect ledger accounts, (5) preparation of the trial balance, and (6) drafting of the financial statements. Other courses focus less on the process and more on the calculation of formulae or the application of regulatory standards to derive individual accounting numbers or to prepare forms and filings.</p>
