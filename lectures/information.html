      <h2>Accounting Architecture</h2>

          <p>Sound information is the goal of an information system, and the Information section of the accounting architecture model lists the activities necessary to obtain the right data and convert it into the right information. Much of that data is traditional business data, but recently, information systems have increasingly focused on Big Data. The best information systems are flexible enough to support the creation, maintenance, and use of both types of data for the benefit of internal and external decision makers.</p>
        </div>
      </div>

    <section>
      <h2>Accounting for Data</h2>
      <p>The ability to convert data into information has always been the primary focus of the accounting profession. Textbooks often refer to this role as &ldquo;measuring and reporting on economic events.&rdquo; Introductory financial accounting courses represent this task as involving (1) identification of the affected accounts, (2) determination of the effect on the accounting identity, (3) recording of the journal entry, (4) posting to the respective ledger accounts, (5) preparation of the trial balance, and (6) drafting of the financial statements. Other courses focus less on the process and more on the calculation of formulae or the application of regulatory standards to derive individual accounting numbers or to prepare forms and filings.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Data Sources</h2>
      <p>However, the steps in measuring and reporting on economic events as described by accounting courses is incomplete and leaves a number of questions unanswered. For example, how should accountants acquire enough data to know which accounts are affected by a transaction? How should they learn about the economic event in the first place? The generally accepted answer to these questions is to use <u><em>source documents</em></u>. These are the physical or digital documents that initiate and provide evidence of a transaction, such as a sales order or a check stub from a customer or an invoice from a vendor. With these documents, accountants can identify which accounts are affected by a particular transaction (e.g., cash and accounts payable for a vendor invoice).</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Not in the Beginning</h2>
      <p>Unfortunately, the importance of source documents merely serves to raise four more questions: How will these source documents be generated? How can businesses guarantee that all transactions have a source document? How can accountants be sure to receive all source documents? How can businesses ensure that source documents contain all relevant data for accountants? These questions are not evidence that source documents are not useful, rather they clearly prove that measuring and reporting begins before the receipt of a source document. Source documents will not magically come into existence and then into the position of an accountant. Additional action is necessary in order to ensure that accountants have the data that they need in order to conduct measurement and reporting activities.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Not the Middle or the End, Either</h2>
      <p>The problem with the six-step reporting procedure is not only the incorrect identification of the first step. The procedure leaves questions open about the middle and the end, as well. How are journal entries or ledger posts stored, classified, and subsequently retrieved in order to generate financial statements? Since journal entries and ledger balances are not the only financial statement inputs, how are all other necessary inputs identified and gathered in order to create financial statements? Financial statements are not the only accounting report, so what are reports are necessary, and how are they generated and communicated for stakeholders and decision makers? What happens to accounting data once these reports have been generated?</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>The Responsible Way</h2>
      <p>With so many questions regarding measurement and recording left unanswered, accountants must make a choice. They can either assume that some other business function will provide them with all necessary data and instructions in order to measure and report successfully or assume the responsibility of information custodian and become self-reliant. This self-reliance necessitates the identification of an alternative, more complete series of tasks to implement in order to acquire important business data and convert it into valuable business information and reports. Fortunately, the information sciences discipline has developed just such a series: the <u><em>information life cycle</em></u> (ILC). The ILC explains how to know what data to collect, how to collect it, how to use it to create information, and what to do with the data after it has outlived its usefulness.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Long, Long Ago</h2>
      <p>100 years ago, the management of documents and records in businesses and governments was typically a matter of chance and secretaries' preference. Then came Emmet J. Leahy, a former military man hired by the U.S. Federal Government to get a handle on their out-of-control document storage. The goal was to find all the records in all the basements, attics, and filing cabinets and then decide what to do with them. Emmet J. Leahy envisioned a better way for the future: a system to manage records and documents that would be in place before the document or record was created, guiding the use and storage of documents from creation to destruction. Leahy created the analog predecessor to the information life cycle model that helps govern digital information systems.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>The Modern Information Life Cycle</h2>
      <div class="override"><img src="../images/ilc.png" alt="Information Life Cycle" style="max-height: 250px"/></div>
      <p>The modern-day ILC explains what an information system should do. The ILC contains 13 steps grouped into three phases. The <u><em>Creation</em></u> phase includes the steps necessary to bring data into the information system. The <u><em>Maintenance</em></u> phase contains the steps to ensure that data is findable when needed. The <u><em>Use</em></u> phase comprises the steps to convert data into information.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>You Must Remember This...</h2>
      <p>The arrow shapes in the ILC graphic seem to imply an order of events. Although certain life cycle steps precede others, the ILC is less of a roadmap or a set of directions and more of a blueprint. The has two implications. First, the steps in the ILC may not be in the same order at all times for all types of data. Second, and more importantly, an information system should be completely designed, according to the guidelines in this blueprint, before attempting to acquire any data. The Technology section of the accounting architecture model highlights the technologies that make up the information system, and they serve to implement the ILC. As a result, when selecting information technologies, it is important to keep in mind which tasks in the ILC the technology will help to accomplish.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Creation Phase: Needs Assessment</h2>
      <p>The first step in the ILC is the <u><em>needs assessment</em></u>. This step is first because it identifies the informational needs of internal and external stakeholders that the information system should satisfy. The understanding is necessary in order to design a useful information system. Conducting a needs assessment is very simple but vitally important:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Evaluate the current information, skills, and processes in place.</li>
        <li>Determine what information organization requires in order to meet its objectives.</li>
        <li>Compare the results of the first two steps to demonstrate which information, skills, or processes need to be added and which can be removed.</li>
      </ol>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Which Came First?</h2>
      <p>Needs assessment is unique among the steps in the ILC because it is the only planning task. The remainder of the steps in the life cycle are the tasks in converting data into information. This can create confusion regarding the order of events. First, the needs assessment determines what information the information system should generate. Second, IT and business specialists collaborate to design a system that will successfully implement the remaining steps in the ILC to bring necessary information to decision makers. Third, the completed information system leads data through the steps in the information life cycle to generate business information and reports. Fourth, as necessary, a new needs assessment is conducted in order to discover the need for modifications to the information system.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Creation Phase: Acquisition</h2>
      <p><u><em>Acquistion</em></u> is the first step in the ILC that occurs after the design and implementation of the information system, and it is also the first step that directly affects business data. Acquisition is the act of obtaining data, either from external sources (e.g., source documents) or from previously owned data (e.g., internal reports) to enter into your system. Although this step is the first time an organization will handle a data object, it is not the point at which that object is ready to enter the information system. A retail store provides a useful analogy for understanding the difference in timing between data acquisition and data entry into a system: an inventory item that has been acquired is not ready for the shelves without additional processing steps.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Creation Phase: Classification</h2>
      <p>The first of these additional processing steps prior to data entry is <u><em>classification</em></u>, which is the act of assigning descriptive attributes to a data item. These descriptives attributes are called <u><em>metadata</em></u>. Metadata is literally data about data. In other words, it is what the data, be it a single number or an entire document, means. Metadata captures the context of a resource and the processes defining its use. Without its metadata, a document or data point has no meaning or relevance. The purpose of metadata is to describe; this in turn makes it easier to find and retrieve an object or data item and understand it. The purpose of data classification is to promote findability.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Metadata Gives Life Meaning</h2>
      <p>The use of units is a simple example of metadata. The Monetary Unit Principle of the FASB Conceptual Framework identifies the US dollar as the unit of measurement for financial statements, but the number 1,000 on a financial statement could be in dollars, thousands or dollars, or even millions of dollars. Each of these units gives the number 1,000 a different meaning. Similarly, when measuring and reporting distances, the number 1,000 could be in centimeters, feet, or miles. Each of these lengths gives the number 1,000 a different meaning that is also very different from 1,000 dollars. The units of measurement are a form of metadata that gives a number a particular meaning. Without units, the number 1,000 has no meaning.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>What Shall We Play?</h2>
      <p>The importance of metadata for lending meaning extends beyond single numbers to entire documents or files. If a radio studio had 10,000 songs with incremented file names (i.e., 0000.mp3, 0001.mp3, 0002.mp3, etc.), how would the DJ know which song to choose? Put differently, what is the meaning of 0145.mp3? Meaning is this case could be song title, artist, album, and year, but without metadata a DJ would not know that 0145.mp3 means Bohemian Rhapsody by Queen on A Night at the Opera from 1975. In order to find the track with that meaning, the DJ would need to listen to each file in order to find the correct one. In a set of 10,000 files, listening to each in order to find a specific one would make for a lousy radio station. However, with the proper metadata to give the files meaning, the DJ can always retrieve the correct song.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>ATTRIBUTE : value</h2>
      <p>Metadata relies on pairs of <u><em>attributes</em></u> and <u><em>values</em></u>. An attribute is a characteristic of a data object. Each attribute takes on a different value for each data object. For example, a book may have the attributes title, author, year, and publisher, and a specific book would have the following attribute-value pairs:</p>
      <ul style="list-style-type: none; display: inline-block">
        <li>(ATTRIBUTE) : (value)</li>
        <li>TITLE : The Open Organization</li>
        <li>AUTHOR : Jim Whitehurst</li>
        <li>YEAR : 2015</li>
        <li>PUBLISHER : Harvard Business Review Press</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>A Question of Formatting</h2>
      <p><u><em>eXtensible Markup Language</em></u> (XML) is a popular convention for formatting metadata using tags. The &lt;tag&gt; corresponds to the attribute, and the text between the open &lt;tag&gt; and the close &lt;/tag&gt; is the value, such that XML reads &lt;attribute&gt;value&lt;/attribute&gt;. The same book listed previously would have the following XML-formatted metadata:</p>
      <ul style="list-style-type: none; display: inline-block">
        <li>&lt;metadata&gt;
          <ul style="list-style-type: none">
            <li>&lt;title&gt;The Open Organization&lt;/title&gt;</li>
            <li>&lt;creator&gt;Jim Whitehurst&lt;/creator&gt;</li>
            <li>&lt;year&gt;2015&lt;/year&gt;</li>
            <li>&lt;publisher&gt;Harvard Business Review Press&lt;/publisher&gt;</li>
          </ul>
          &lt;/metadata&gt;
        </li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Financial Statement Metadata</h2>
      <p><u><em>eXtensible Business Reporting Language</em></u> (XBRL)</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Creation Phase: Conversion and Ingestion</h2>
      <p><u><em>Conversion</em></u> is the transformation of data from its current format to a more desirable format for the purposes of storage. This might be done to promote uniformity or to conform the data to the technology that is already in use in the information system. Scanning a document to create a PDF is one example.</p>
      <p>The final step in the Creation phase is  <u><em>ingestion</em></u>, which is when data enters in information system. Data entry can be manual or automated and <u><em>continuous</em></u> or <u><em>batch</em></u>. Continuous ingestion is a greater burden on information system resources, but it makes data available immediately. Batch ingestion uses resources more efficiently by entering data in groups (i.e., batches) when information system resources are not needed by other functions (e.g., after work hours).</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Who Needs What When?</h2>
      <p>Although continuous data entry is more resource-intensive than batch entry, it is necessary when a business entity must respond immediately to the data. For example, sales orders require continuous ingestion so that sales people can fill customer orders as soon as possible. On the other hand, the ingestion of employee time cards can be in batches because the generation of paychecks and pay stubs will rarely immediately follow the receipt of a time card. However, neither of these examples is necessarily true in all cases. For example, sales orders may be suited to batch ingestion if the finished good takes a long time to complete (e.g., a house). A needs assessment should identify which data needs continuous ingestion and which data can wait for batch ingestion.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Maintenance Phase: Storage</h2>
      <p><u><em>Storage</em></u> is both the act of storing physical and digital data, as well as the method of storing that data, for future use. The principles of storage are straightforward and unchanging. One key to successful storage is choosing the appropriate medium for each data object. Considerations include the length of time the data should be stored, desired ease of access to the data, and expected future increases (i.e., scalability) in storage needs. Here again, a needs assessment will discover what medium is appropriate for which data. It is not feasible to store a horse underneath a bed, nor is it wise to store large files marked for permanent retention on cheaply made thumb drives.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>You Cannot Store Everything</h2>
      <p>Another key to successful storage is identifying what data is important enough to store in the first place. The world is full of data, and storing more than is absolutely necessary increases costs and makes necessary less findable and useable.</p>
      <blockquote>There's a temptation to think that you're just going to store everything. First, that's a fool's errand because it will break the bank. Yes, storage is getting cheaper, but it's not getting cheaper as fast as we're getting more data. And second, it just doesn't make good business sense.<br>&ndash; Jeffrey Crigler, CTO, Catalist</blockquote>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Maintenance Phase: Indexing</h2>
      <p>The goal of the classification and storage steps is to make the right data retrievable when needed. <u><em>Indexing</em></u> increases findability by creating an additional data store of <u><em>keys</em></u> and <u><em>pointers</em></u>. An index is a store of metadata. The metadata attribute identifies the type of index, the metadata value is the key, and the pointer identifies the location of the data object the metadata describes. A library catalog of book titles, a keyword index in the back of a textbook, or a list of song titles in a playlist are all examples of indexes. Looking for a key in an index and then following the pointer to the data object is faster than through an entire data store for the desired data item. Indexing is not a requirement in order to retrieve data, but the creation of an index can save valuable time, as well as computing resources when data is needed.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Maintenance Phase: Refreshing and Interpretation</h2>
      <p><u><em>Refreshing</em></u> updates data stores to ensure that data and metadata are current and up-to-date. Refreshing also preserves data from corruption over time by creating fresh but still identical copies of stored data.</p>
      <p><u><em>Interpretation</em></u> is the selection and preservation of hardware and software necessary to access data from digital data stores. Software and hardware frequently change, and the selection of storage technologies will not guarantee data accessibility permanently. For example, floppy discs won't fit in CD drives. Laser discs are only useful with access to a working laser disc player. Microsoft Access files require a Microsoft Access.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Use Phase: Searching</h2>
      <p>The Use section of the architecture is the apex of the arch, and it represents the goals of the entire information system: accessing and using the data in the system to create valuable information for organizational stakeholders. <u><em>Searching</em></u> is the act of looking for something; in a digital information system this is done through <u><em>queries</em></u>, or search commands. When searching is executed properly it allows the information system to do what it is designed to do, allowing an organization to access its resources. Before a user can perform an efficient query, the objects in the system need classification with metadata during the creation phase. Lastly, it’s helpful to note that searches are most effective when performed by persons trained in effective search techniques.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Use Phase: Analytics</h2>
      <p><u><em>Analytics</em></u> is a popular buzzword, but it is simply the process of using business data to make informed decisions and gain additional insights about that business. The terms <u><em>business intelligence</em></u> and <u><em>business analytics</em></u> are used interchangeably, and are newer concepts that are loosely defined as the skills, tools, technologies, and techniques used to gather and understand data to make informed business decisions. The specific data analysis tools you use in your profession will largely depend on your employer’s preferences and the information with which you are working.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Use Phase: Reporting</h2>
      <p><u><em>Reporting</em></u> is a familiar concept. Many of the reports created by accountants are driven by regulation compliance. It follows that these reports by law must contain accurate information. Various reports may be generated for clients, marketing, or other outside entities as well. However, the most important consumers of reports are internal decision makers. These decision makers use business data from the information system to make strategic decisions for the firm. All of these reports rely on accurate business data.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Maintenance Phase: Disposition</h2>
      <p>The decision point where an organization decides when and how an information object will leave the information system is known as <u><em>disposition</em></u>. Items marked for retention are moved to long term storage. Licensed items might be returned to the owner. Useless information is scheduled for deletion, sensitive items are destroyed, and valuable items may be transferred or sold to another organization. These decisions should never be made on a case-by-case basis, but instead should be in accordance with <u><em>disposition schedules</em></u>, an organization's specific guidelines for disposing of information at the end of its useful life.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Show Me Something</h2>
      <p>A creative, popular, and increasingly effective way of communicating the results from the analytics step of both life cycles is the <u><em>visualization</em></u>. Of all the human senses, vision is processed by the brain the fastest. This means that a strong visual representation can convey more information faster than any other method. In addition, the human visual faculties can be very good at distinguishing patterns and differences, an advantage that can be used wisely when preparing reports and creating graphs, tables, or infographics.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Would I Lie To You?</h2>
      <p>Visualizations are powerful tools, and when using them it is important to strive to tell the truth with integrity. It is not difficult to manipulate the graphics in a visualization to distort or exaggerate the effect in the data. Do not ever allow this; decision makers rely on accurate representations of business data. Strategic planning that is based on inaccurate ideas of what the business data indicates is dangerous.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>What About Big Data?</h2>
      <p><u><em>Big Data</em></u> is the bandwagon every firm is trying to jump on in this decade. Three characteristics distinguish Big Data from regular data. <u><em>Volume</em></u>, the reason Big Data is referred to as &ldquo;Big&rdquo; connotes the large amounts of data businesses receive from transactions, machine communication, and social media interactions. <u><em>Velocity</em></u> references the high rate at which these large amounts of data are created and processed. <u><em>Variety</em></u> describes the lack of uniformity in data sources containing text, audio, video, image, and other data types. Each of these characteristics present challenges that require new approaches.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Risky Business</h2>
      <p>Big Data, when used wisely, offers firms the opportunity to improve knowledge discovery, solve problems, offer superior customer service, and increase profits. However, Big Data is not always accurate, reliable, or ethical to use. There are definitely risks to overemphasizing the importance of Big Data. Allocating storage to preserve useless data costs money. Analyzing data for the sake of itself wastes staff time and resources. Basing business decisions on inaccurate information can cause significant damage to a company’s profits and reputations. Each of these has a cost, without providing sufficient organizational value in exchange. Big Data, like all information, should be used to contribute to an organization’s goals.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Big Data Life Cycle</h2>
      <p>The five steps presented in bold italics are steps that apply only to Big Data, and they replace steps in the ILC. Steps with an asterisk share a name with an ILC step, but manifest differently to accommodate the unique nature of Big Data.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>BDLC vs. ILC: Creation Phase</h2>
      <p>When examining Big Data, a needs assessment differs from the traditional ILC in one significant way: the volume of data makes it difficult to ascertain exactly which data items will be useful. Instead, the data sources (i.e. pools) which are most likely to provide useful data are identified. Then, instead of acquiring only what is needed, Collection involves gathering all of the data from those previously identified pools. Sifting is the evaluative process that follows; data that has been collected is examined and unnecessary data is deleted. This alleviates the need to process data that will only prove useless later on. Lastly, synchronization pairs or correlates this Big Data with existing business data.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>BDLC vs. ILC: Maintenance Phase</h2>
      <p>The changes in Storage are some of the most significant because the underlying technology is very different. Big Data’s volume and variety make it ill-suited to traditional storage technologies, and a variety of creative data stores have been developed to address these issues.</p>
      <p>Pre-processing replaces indexing as a means of transforming data into more usable information. Cleaning and manipulation, which must be completed before data analysis, occur during this step. This includes removing duplicates, checking for integrity violations, filtering, sorting, and grouping appropriate data together. Not all data, however, is subject to pre-processing.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>BDLC vs. ILC: Use Phase</h2>
      <p>Monitoring replaces searching in the Use phase of the Big Data life cycle. Although real-time analytics is on the rise, manual searching of Big Data remains rare. Automated monitoring of trends and outliers is more common. One reason for this is that unlike traditional business and accounting data, managers will frequently not know what story Big Data tells or even what to look for. Monitoring can find the message hidden within Big Data. These differences affect Analytics in a similar fashion.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>The Long and the Short</h2>
      <p>In looking at an information system of any kind, it’s best if you can see the end from the beginning; remember the concept of the blueprint. All of those steps within the ILC should be used to guide your system to meet your organization’s needs, the primary of which is usefulness. Data needs to be findable, accessible, understandable, and usable. Without understanding the information system, accountants can only hope that accurate data makes it into the hands of decision makers. With a complete view, accountants can facilitate the reporting of complete and accurate information. Lastly, don’t be intimidated by the sheer amount of data out there. The pursuit of knowledge should be the goal, not the pursuit of more data.</p>
