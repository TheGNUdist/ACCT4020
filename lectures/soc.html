      <h2>What's Best for Business</h2>
      <p>Data breaches are bad for business. According to <a href="http://www.gemalto.com/brochures-site/download-site/Documents/Identity/ent-Breach_Level_Index_Annual_Report_2015.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener" aria-label="PDF opens in new window">one report</a>, in 2015 over 700 million records were breached in nearly 1,700 cyber incidents. That equates to 22 records leaked every second. 62% of cyber incidents were initiated by outsiders, 14% were initiated by malicious insiders (i.e., fraud), and 24% were accidental (i.e., error). <a href="https://www.experian.com/assets/data-breach/white-papers/2015-industry-forecast-experian.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener" aria-label="PDF opens in new window">Experian</a> predicts that insider fraud and error will continue to be a significant contributor to data leaks. In 2014, US companies reported $40 billion in losses stemming from breaches caused by employees. Currently, companies lose billions of dollars more because of externally initiated cyber incidents, and by 2020, data breach costs reached as high as $2 trillion worldwide.</p>

      <h2>Sony</h2>
      <p>Sony is no stranger to cyber incidents. In April 2011, the PlayStation Network experienced a month-long outage following an attack that leaked 77 million accounts and over 12,000 credit card numbers. At the time it was viewed as the largest breach in history, and Sony estimated outage costs at $171 million. This number excludes the cost of litigation, fines, and consumer credit protection that Sony provided to all account holders.</p>
      <p>Then, in November 2014, a hacker group leaked data from Sony Pictures including employee information, private emails, and corporate documents and unreleased films. Sony has paid millions in connection with this attack.</p>

    <section>
      <h2>Yahoo!</h2>
      <p>Yahoo is the grand champion of cyber incidents. In 2013 and 2014 combined, two data breaches affected over 1.5 billion accounts. Each breach by itself is larger than any breach experienced by any other company in the history of the Internet. In both cases, hackers leaked account information and security data, including security questions and answers. Yahoo announced the breaches in 2016 after Verizon had made an offer to acquire Yahoo for $4.8 billion. Verizon subsequently reduced the price by $350 million.</p>

    <section>
      <h2>Credit Card Hack</h2>
      <p>Several retailers have experienced breaches of credit card data in recent years. Two of the most prominent members of this list are Target with 70 million customers affected and Home Depot with 56 million customers affected. In both cases, hackers remotely accessed and infected point-of-sale (POS) systems by using stolen login credentials from vendors. POS systems are a popular target for credit card theft, and several other retailers have also been affected, such as Wendy's, Staples, UPS, P.F. Chang's, and Sally Beauty. However, in the case of the largest credit card leak, affecting 94 million T. J. Maxx customers, hackers stole the credit card numbers from the corporate system simply by hacking the wireless network at a single store.</p>

      <h2>Internal Controls</h2>
      <p><em><u>Internal controls</u></em> can help companies manage fraud and error risks. Internal controls are activities or tools designed to protect data, assets, business processes, and compliance objectives (e.g., financial reporting) from error and fraud. In the context of the fraud triangle, internal controls primarily focus on reducing the opportunity to commit fraud (as well as cause unintentional errors), but certain control objectives also address perceived pressure and rationalization.</p>

      <h2>COSO</h2>
      <div class="flex-row">
        <div class="flex-item" style="max-width: 70%">
          <p>The <em><u>Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission</u></em> (COSO) has created a framework for designing and implementing internal controls that &ldquo;achieve the entity's objectives and adapt to changes in the business and operating environments.&rdquo; COSO identifies three control objectives, five components of internal control, and four entity units. The objectives highlight the business goals that require internal controls, and the units are the relevant business levels for implementing internal controls.</p>

    <section>
      <h2>Regulatory Oversight</h2>
      <p>The <u><em>Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002</em></u> (SOX) requires firms to implement internal controls over financial reporting to prevent material misstatements. Congress instituted this statute in response to the egregious accounting frauds in the late 90s and early 2000s at Enron, Worldcom, and others. SOX sections 302 and 404 require management to maintain and assess internal controls over financial reporting.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Control Environment</h2>
      <p>The first internal control component is the <u><em>control environment</em></u>. This component focuses on the importance of having a strong &ldquo;tone at the top.&rdquo; The five principles of control environment are:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Organization commits to ethics and integrity.</li>
        <li>Board is independent of management and oversees the development of internal controls.</li>
        <li>Management establishes an organizational hierarchy with limits on individual authority.</li>
        <li>Organization commits to hire, develop, and retain competent employees.</li>
        <li>Employees are held accountable for their internal control responsibilities.</li>
      </ol>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Risk Assessment</h2>
      <p>The second internal control component is <u><em>risk assessment</em></u>. This component concentrates on the identification of risks that could prevent successful achievement of the entity's objectives. Its four principles are:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Organization specifies business objectives.</li>
        <li>Organization identifies potential internal and external risks and determines how to manage them.</li>
        <li>Organization considers the potential for fraud.</li>
        <li>Organization identifies environmental changes that could affect internal controls.</li>
      </ol>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Information &amp; Communication</h2>
      <p>The third internal control component is <u><em>information and communication</em></u>. This component highlights the need to report on internal control activities. This creates a new level of informational need in the organization, in addition to the need to report on the business processes themselves. The three principles of this component are:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Management identifies information requirements of the internal control system.</li>
        <li>Employees internally communicate information to support proper functioning of internal controls.</li>
        <li>Organization reports on internal controls to external stakeholders.</li>
      </ol>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Monitoring Activities</h2>
      <p>The fourth internal control component is <u><em>monitoring activities</em></u>. Once internal controls are in place, or are believed to be in place, they must be monitored to confirm that they are present and functioning. The two principles of this component are:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Organization performs ongoing evaluations to ascertain whether internal controls are present and functioning.</li>
        <li>Employees communicate any observed internal control deficiencies to responsible parties in a timely fashion.</li>
      </ol>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Control Activities</h2>
      <p>The final internal control component is <u><em>control activities</em></u>. Although this is the last in the list, it should not be viewed as the final step in a sequence, nor should the other components be viewed as depicting a sequence of activities, rather these combine to create a blueprint of internal controls, just as the information life cycle creates a blueprint for an information system. This component focuses on the specific internal control activities. Its three principles are:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Organization selects control activities.</li>
        <li>Organization selects IT controls.</li>
        <li>Organization implements controls through explicit policies and procedures.</li>
      </ol>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>IT Control Framework</h2>
      <p>Similar to COSO's Internal Control&ndash;Integrated Framework, the AICPA has created the <u><em>Trust Services Principles</em></u> (TSC) for designing and implementing IT controls. TSC fits into the broader scope of IC&ndash;IF and ERM&ndash;IF by addressing IT-specific risks and control activities. This framework contains five control concepts:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><u><em>Security</em></u> protects against unauthorized access.</li>
        <li><u><em>Confidentiality</em></u> and <u><em>privacy</em></u> maintain data secrecy.</li>
        <li><u><em>Availability</em></u> prevents data loss and system downtime.</li>
        <li><u><em>Processing integrity</em></u> preserves data integrity.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>SOC</h2>
      <p>Statement on Standards for Attestation Engagements 18 prescribes three types of System and Organization Controls (SOC) reports on the design (Type I) and operational effectiveness (Type II) of internal controls.</p>
      <ul>
        <li><u><em>SOC 1</em></u> Internal Control over Financial Reporting (ICFR)</li>
        <li><u><em>SOC 2</em></u> Trust Services Criteria</li>
        <li><u><em>SOC 3</em></u> Trust Services Criteria for General Use Report</li>
      </ul>
