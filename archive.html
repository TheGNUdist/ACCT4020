					<h1>Open</h1>
					<p class="summary">This lecture introduces several forms of open content. Understanding open technologies is an important precursor to understanding enterprise-grade information systems. This is also the first topic for which we will have student presentations. The final lecture contains a list of extra-credit topics.</p>
					<p class="summary"><b>For the online students</b>: Five presentations for this topic are due <b>Wednesday, February 3 @ 23.59</b>. You have until end of business on Friday to email me to volunteer for a presentation. Also, I will add a quiz to eCourseware for evaluating these presentations. Every student, except for the presenters, should complete this evaluation by <b>Friday, February 5 @ 23.59</b>. Once the presentations have been posted to eCourseware, I will ask each presenter one or more questions, the presenter will have until <b>Thursday, February 4 @ 23.59</b> to respond. This will be the model for all subsequent presentation dates, as well. Please review the syllabus for grading and submission guidelines.</p>
