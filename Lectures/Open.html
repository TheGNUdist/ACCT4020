		<section>
			<h3>Open Standard</h3>
			<p>A standard is a set of specifications. Although no common definition of <q>open standard</q> exists, the Modern Paradigm for Standards lists a number of characteristics of open standards:
			<ol>
				<li>Cooperation between standards organizations</li>
				<li>Adherence to fundamental principles of standards development: due process, broad consensus, transparency, balance, openness</li>
				<li>Collective empowerment that promotes <u>interoperability</u>, scalability, stability, <u>competition</u> and <u>innovation</u>.</li>
				<li>Availability</li>
				<li>Voluntary Adoption</li>
			</ol>

		<section>
			<h3>In the Beginning</h3>
			<p>(1950s to be exact...)</p>
			<p>Developers shared software code for free without copyright. This may have been in part the result of software being developed for a single hardware architecture, so no application could achieve wide adoption. One popular software development focus was time-sharing applications, which allowed multiple users to use the same computer hardware at the same time.</p>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h3>Then Came the Software License</h3>
			<p>(Turn the clock forward to 1970...)</p>
			<p>Developers transitioned from assembly code (low-level code that was closely tied to machine architecture) to higher-level, architecture-independent code that resulted in more complicated programs. As a result, developers wanted to receive compensation for their effort. Unix, a new, portable operating system, was an early example of software that required the purchase of a license.</p>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h3>What Is a License?</h3>
			<p>A <u><i>license</i></u> allows the owner of intellectual property to grant use to others without giving up ownership.</p>
			<p>What are some common examples of licensing that we encounter?</p>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h3>All Fun and Games Until Someone Gets Hurt</h3>
			<p>In 1979, Richard Stallman worked for MIT, and his department had a Xerox laser printer that would jam. The programmers in the department could have created a program that would have the printer report a jam, but they had no access to the printer's source code, and anyone who had received a copy was under a non-disclosure agreement not to share it.</p>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h3>And Man Created the Free Software Movement</h3>
			<p>In order to combat the power of software vendors and recreate the earlier environment of shared software, Richard Stallman set out to create a free Unix-compatible operating system called GNU. In 1985, he established the Free Software Foundation (FSF) to support the development of free software, and in 1989, he released the GNU General Public License (GPL) for releasing free software.</p> 
		</section>

		<section>
			<h3>Four Freedoms</h3>
			<p>A program is <i><u>free software</u></i> if the program's users have four essential freedoms:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>The freedom to run the program as you wish, for any purpose (freedom 0).</li>
				<li>The freedom to study how the program works, and change it so it does our computing as you wish (freedom 1).</li>
				<li>The freedom to redistribute copies so you can help your neighbor (freedom 2).</li>
				<li>The freedom to distribute copies of your modified versions to others (freedom 3).</li>
			</ul>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h3>Still a License</h3>
			<p>It may seem odd that an opponent of proprietary software licenses should choose to introduce a software license of his own. Could these two attitudes be reconcilable?</p>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h3>FSF is not Alone</h3>
			<p>Since the inception of the the Free Software Foundation, other organizations have joined to promote free software. One prominent example is the Open Source Initiative (OSI). Not all groups agree on the correct approach to free software. For example, OSI believes that Richard Stallman is too extreme. He responded, &ldquo;Open source is a development methodology; free software is a social movement. For the Open Source movement, non-free software is a suboptimal solution. For the Free Software movement, non-free software is a social problem and free software is the solution.&rdquo;</p>
			<p>I remain agnostic because I cannot perceive a difference in free software outcomes, but feel free to form your own opinion.</p>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h3>&ldquo;Free&rdquo; or &ldquo;Open Source&rdquo;?</h3>
			<p>Although <u><i>free software</i></u> is the focus of the FSF and <u><i>open source software</i></u> is the focus of the OSI, these terms are frequently used interchangeably or combined into FOSS (free and open source software).</p>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h3>Gratis versus Libre</h3>
			<p>Free software is free as in freedom <em>not</em> as in beer<br>(or lunch, for economists). Free software is frequently also provided at no cost, but this is a by-product, not the goal. In fact, when Richard Stallman completed Emacs, a text editor for his GNU operating system, he sold copies of the software. The copies he distributed satisfied the four freedoms, but the copy was not <i>gratis</i>.</p>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h3>Prominent Open-source Software Licenses</h3>
			<ul>
				<li>GNU General Public License</li>
				<li>GNU Lesser General Public License</li>
				<li>GNU Affero General Public License</li>
				<li>BSD License</li>
				<li>MIT License</li>
				<li>Mozilla Public License</li>
				<li>Common Development and Distribution License</li>
				<li>Apache License</li>
			</ul>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h3>Philosophy Can Influence Licenses</h3>
			<p>One consequence of differing opinions on what constitutes free software is the restrictiveness of the software license (i.e., what rights the license gives the user).</p>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h3>Prominent Open Source Software Projects</h3>
			<ul>
				<li>Mozilla Firefox (web browser)</li>
				<li>Android (mobile operating system)</li>
				<li>Linux Kernel (operating system kernel)</li>
				<li>FreeBSD (operating system kernel + userland tools)</li>
				<li>Apache HTTP Server (web server)</li>
				<li>MySQL (database)</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Interestingly, the GNU operating system lost steam after a while. It took until 2015 (30 years) for a somewhat usable release. However, the GNU userland tools play a prominent role in other operating systems.</p>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h3>Open-source Hardware Licenses</h3>
			<p>Open source hardware projects frequently co-opt open-source software licenses for their output. Unfortunately, open-source software licenses are not a great fit for hardware projects because these licenses address copyright and not patents. As a result, a few groups have developed hardware-specific open licenses:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>TAPR Open Hardware License</li>
				<li>CERN Open Hardware License</li>
			</ul>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h3>Open System</h3>
			<ul>
				<li><u><i>Interoperability</i></u> allows third parties to develop compatible software or peripherals.</li>
				<li><u><i>Portability</i></u> allows the system to run on multiple hardware architectures.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Because of the interchangeability of parts in a traditional desktop computer, it may be tempting to conclude that towers constitute open hardware. However, open systems can comprise closed components, and it would be more appropriate to refer to these desktops as open systems. Microsoft Windows is another example. What characteristics make this proprietary software an open system?</p>

			<h3>Open Access</h3>

			<a href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/71/PhD_Comics_Open_Access_Week_2012.ogv">Open Access Proposal</a>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h3>Open Access Licenses</h3>
			<p>Open access can apply to any knowledge base or creative work, not simply academic research (generally not recommended for software).</p>
			<ul>
				<li><u><i>Creative Commons License</i></u> (CC) with a combination of the following conditions:</li>
				<ul>
					<li><u><i>Attribution</i></u> (BY) requires giving the creator credit.</li>
					<li><u><i>Share-alike</i></u> (SA) restricts the license of derivative works to be the same as the original.</li>
					<li><u><i>Non-commercial</i></u> (NC) prevents the use of the work for commercial purposes.</li>
					<li><u><i>No Derivative Works</i></u> (ND) allows only verbatim copies.</li>
				</ul>
			</ul>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h3>Thought Experiment</h3>
			<p>Based on the FSF four freedoms, which combination(s) of CC conditions result in a free license?</p>
			<div class="flex-row top">
				<div class="flex-item" style="max-width: 50%">
					<ul>
						<li>Run the program as you wish, for any purpose.</li>
						<li>Study how the program works, and change it so it does our computing as you wish.</li>
						<li>Redistribute copies so you can help your neighbor.</li>
						<li>Distribute copies of your modified versions to others.</li>
					</ul>
				</div>
				<div class="flex-item" style="max-width: 50%">
					<ul>
						<li>Attribution (BY) requires giving the creator credit.</li>
						<li>Share-alike (SA) restricts the license of derivative works to be the same as the original.</li>
						<li>Non-commercial (NC) prevents the use of the work for commercial purposes.</li>
						<li>No Derivative Works (ND) allows only verbatim copies.</li>
					</ul>

			<h3>Gratis versus Libre, Again</h3>
			<p>With open access the goal is to provide content at no cost. In this case, <q>gratis</q> and <q>libre</q> both mean free as in beer.</p>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h3>Extra Credit Presentations</h3>
			<ol>
				<li>Compare and contrast <q>copycenter</q>, <q>copyleft</q> and <q>copyfree</q>.</li>
				<li>Introduce three open source licenses: GNU General Public License (GPL), GNU Lesser General Public License (LGPL) and GNU Affero General Public License (AGPL). Explain what purpose each serves and the strengths, weaknesses, pros and cons of each.</li>
				<li>Can and should businesses use proprietary or open source licenses for intellectual property?</li>
			</ol>
