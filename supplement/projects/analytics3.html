      <h3>Analytics III - Intro</h3>
      <p>For this part of the analytics project, you will use SQL to analyze data in the database that you imported previously in order to answer questions that the client has posed. (NB: You must have already completed all steps in Analytics II in order to attempt Analytics III.) The next two screens explain how to create a user to access the database and run queries in a secure fashion. Each screen explains how to complete the required tasks and what information to include in the solution that you upload to eCourseware. Your grade for this deliverable will be based on the accuracy of your commands to create a regular user and the accuracy of your queries and answers to the questions.</p>

      <h3>Create a Regular User</h3>
      <p>Logging in to an operating system or a database management system using the root user is an insecure practice. Instead, create a regular user using the following commands. Take a screenshot, or more than one screenshot, if necessary, of the following commands and paste the screenshot(s) into a document. Each screenshot must display your container name. Export the document to PDF.</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Ensure that the MySQL service is running.</li>
        <li>Log in to MySQL as the root user.</li>
        <li>Create a user: <strong>create user 'you'@'localhost' identified by 'password';</strong> (Replace you with your first name and password with a password of your choosing.)</li>
        <li>Give your regular user permission to query your database: <br><strong>grant select on database.* to 'you'@'localhost';</strong> (Replace database with the name of the database you created in part 1 of this project and you with the name of the user you created in the previous step.)</li>
        <li>Update privileges: <strong>flush privileges;</strong></li>
        <li>Exit MySQL and log back in as the regular user using the same command as in step 2 but replacing root with the name of your regular user.</li>
      </ol>
    </section>

    <section style="font-size: 28px">
      <h3>Run Queries</h3>
      <p>Take a screenshot of as much of the output of each query as possible, and paste all screenshots into a single document. Each screenshot must display your container name. Beneath each screenshot type the question asked and the answer that your query returned. Export that document to PDF.</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Which payment ID(s) have no purchase order number?</li>
        <p style="margin: 0">SELECT ID FROM PAYMENT WHERE PO IS NULL;</p>
        <li>What is total sales revenue for the current period?</li>
        <p style="margin: 0">SELECT SUM(PRICE * QUANTITY * (1 - PROMOTION)) FROM SALE;</p>
        <li>How many employees work at each location?</li>
        <p style="margin: 0">SELECT LOCATION, COUNT(ID) FROM EMPLOYEE GROUP BY LOCATION;</p>
        <li>Which employees processed invoices?</li>
        <p style="margin: 0">SELECT DISTINCT B.NAME FROM INVOICE AS A JOIN CUSTOMER AS B<br>ON A.PROCESSOR = B.USERNAME;</p>
        <li>Which, if any, receipt(s) have a different quantity of raw materials delivered than were ordered in the purchase order?</li>
        <p style="margin: 0">SELECT A.ID, A.PO, A.QUANTITY - B.QUANTITY FROM RECEIPT AS A JOIN PURCHASE AS B<br>ON A.PO = B.ID WHERE A.QUANTITY != B.QUANTITY;</p>
