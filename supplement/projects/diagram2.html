      <h3>Diagram II - Intro</h3>
      <p>For this part of the diagram project, you will read the narrative of a business process and convert the narrative into a flowchart using the diagramming software of your choice. <a href="https://www.draw.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" aria-label="Website opens in new window">Draw.io</a> is a free, online diagramming tool that you may use, but you may choose another software tool if you prefer. You can find helpful training videos on drawing flowcharts on the <a href="https://about.draw.io/features/training-material/#videos" target="_blank" rel="noopener" aria-label="Website opens in new window">Draw.io website</a>. The next screen provides the business process narrative. Your flowchart must include: (1) a vertical pool that lists the name of the process and the individual agents in the process, (2) all shapes necessary to describe the data and control flows in the process. If you use Draw.io, all required shapes will be in the Basic, Advanced, and Flowchart templates. When you have completed your flowchart, first, save a copy (if you use Draw.io, this will be a DRAWIO file), and second, export the flowchart as a PDF file. Upload both files to Dropbox on eCourseware.</p>

      <h3>Narrative</h3>
      <p>The materials requisition process begins with the Manufacturing agent preparing a multi-copy raw materials requisition. The Manufacturing agent files one copy of the requsition and sends one copy to the Warehouse. The Warehouse agent authorizes the requisition, converting the requsition document into an authorized requisition document. The Warehouse agent then releases the goods to Manufacturing and submits the authorized requsition to Inventory Control. The Inventory Control agent updates the Inventory database and files the authorized requisition.</p>
