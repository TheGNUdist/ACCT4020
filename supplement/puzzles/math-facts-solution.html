			<h3>Tough Math</h3>
			<ol>
				<li>Given a sack of sugar, an unbalanced scale, and two five-pound weights, measure exactly 10 pounds of sugar.</li>
				<li>A 100-pound watermelon is out in the sun. 99% of the watermelon's weight is water. After a few hours, 98% of the watermelon's weight is water. How many pounds of water have evaporated?</li>
				<li>A bathroom scale is off by a consistent amount. According to the scale, Jim weighs 170 pounds, and his wife weighs 130 pounds. When they are on the scale together, they weigh 292 pounds. By how much is the scale off?</li>
			</ol>

			<h3>Solution</h3>
			<ol>
				<li>Place the two weights on one side of the scale and pour sugar in the other side until it balances. Take the weights out and fill the side that had the weights with sugar until the scale balances again. That is exactly 10 pounds of sugar.</li>
				<li>50 pounds. The rind and the fruit combined are 1% of the weight (i.e., 1 pound). In order for them to become 2% of the weight, the watermelon needs to weigh only 50 pounds, so 50 pounds need to have evaporated.</li>
				<li>8 pounds. 292 - (Jim's weight + error) = Wife's actual weight. Jim's weight plus the scale error equal 170 pounds. 292 - 170 = 122, so the wife actually weighs 122 pounds, and the scale is off by 8 pounds.</li>
