			<h3>Logic Problem - Intro</h3>
			<p>You have begun a project to research four endangered species: eldar elk, lisner cat, nibner newt, and perens pig. Assign each species to its respective current population (245, 385, 420, and 490) and the respective year it was first recognized as endangered (2006, 2007, 2008, and 2009). The facts on the next slide are necessary to find a solution.</p>
			<p>You may use this <a href="logic-problem.png" target="_blank" aria-label="Image opens in new window">template</a> to help you solve this problem. Regardless of whether you use the template, you should save your solution as PDF and upload it to Dropbox on eCourseware.</p>
