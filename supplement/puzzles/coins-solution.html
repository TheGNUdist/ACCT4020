			<h3>Coins for Coynes</h3>
			<p>You are in a room with 100 bags of coins each with 100 coins, but only one bag has gold coins. The only difference between the 100 gold coins and the rest of the coins is that a gold coin weighs 1.01 ounce and the other coins each weigh 1 ounce. The room also has a scale, but the scale only works once. You also have a marker that you can use to label bags and/or coins, as needed. How can you identify the gold coins?</p>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h3>Solution</h3>
			<p>Place all bags in order from 1 to 100. Take one coin from the first bag, two coins from the second, as so on until you have taken 100 coins from bag 100. Place the resulting coins&mdash;remember the induction proof to calculate how many coins that would be&mdash;on the scale. The number of ounces the scale reports above 5,050 is the number of gold coins and the corresponding bag number of the gold coins.</p>
