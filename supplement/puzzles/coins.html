			<h3>Coins for Coynes</h3>
			<p>You are in a room with 100 bags of coins each with 100 coins, but only one bag has gold coins. The only difference between the 100 gold coins and the rest of the coins is that a gold coin weighs 1.01 ounce and the other coins each weigh 1 ounce. Otherwise, the coins are indistinguishable. The difference in weight between 100 gold coins and 100 non-gold coins is too small to detect without a scale. Fortunately, the room has a scale, but as soon as you set something on the scale it reports the weight and immediately breaks (i.e., you cannot use the scale a second time, nor can you add something to or remove something from the scale to obtain a second reading). Furthermore, the scale has a max weight of 5,000 ounces, and it cannot report any weight above this number. You also have a marker that you can use to label bags and/or coins, as needed. How can you identify the gold coins?</p>
