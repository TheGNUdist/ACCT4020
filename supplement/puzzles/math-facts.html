      <h3>Tricky Math</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>A 100-pound watermelon is out in the sun. 99% of the watermelon's weight is water. After a few hours, 98% of the watermelon's weight is water. How many pounds of water have evaporated?</li>
        <li>A bathroom scale is off by a consistent amount. According to the scale, Jim weighs 170 pounds, and his wife weighs 130 pounds. When they are on the scale together, they weigh 292 pounds. By how much is the scale off?</li>
        <li>You begin to fill a bucket with water at 9 am. Each minute you double the amount of water in the bucket. If it takes you 1 hour to fill the bucket, at what time is the bucket one-quarter full?</li>
      </ol>
      <p>Write your answers to these questions with an explanation of your solution, save them as a PDF, and upload the PDF to Dropbox on eCourseware.</p>
