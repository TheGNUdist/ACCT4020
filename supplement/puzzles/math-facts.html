			<ol>
				<li>Given a sack of sugar, an unbalanced scale, and two five-pound weights, measure exactly 10 pounds of sugar.</li>
				<li>A 100-pound watermelon is out in the sun. 99% of the watermelon's weight is water. After a few hours, 98% of the watermelon's weight is water. How many pounds of water have evaporated?</li>
				<li>A bathroom scale is off by a consistent amount. According to the scale, Jim weighs 170 pounds, and his wife weighs 130 pounds. When they are on the scale together, they weigh 292 pounds. By how much is the scale off?</li>
