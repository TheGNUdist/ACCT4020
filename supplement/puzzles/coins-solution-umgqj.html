			<h3>Coins for Coynes</h3>
			<p>You are in a room with 100 bags of coins each with 100 coins, but only one bag has gold coins. The only difference between the 100 gold coins and the rest of the coins is that a gold coin weighs 1.01 ounce and the other coins each weigh 1 ounce. Otherwise, the coins are indistinguishable. The difference in weight between 100 gold coins and 100 non-gold coins is too small to detect without a scale. Fortunately, the room has a scale, but as soon as you set something on the scale it reports the weight and immediately breaks (i.e., you cannot use the scale a second time, nor can you add something to or remove something from the scale to obtain a second reading). You also have a marker that you can use to label bags and/or coins, as needed. How can you identify the gold coins? Write your solution, save it as PDF, and upload it to Dropbox on eCourseware.</p>

			<h3>Solution</h3>
			<p>Label all bags in order from 1 to 100. Take one coin from bag 1, two coins from bag 2, three coins from bag 3, as so on until you have taken 100 coins from bag 100. Place the resulting coins on the scale. The decimal number of ounces the scale reports above 5,050 is the number of gold coins and the corresponding bag number of the gold coins. For example, if the scale reads 5,050.01, then bag 1 has the gold coins; if the scale reads 5,050.02, then bag 2 has the gold coins; if the scale reads 5,051, then bag 100 has the gold coins.</p>
