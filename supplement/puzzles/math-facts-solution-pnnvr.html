      <h3>Tricky Math</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>A 100-pound watermelon is out in the sun. 99% of the watermelon's weight is water. After a few hours, 98% of the watermelon's weight is water. How many pounds of water have evaporated?</li>
        <li>A bathroom scale is off by a consistent amount. According to the scale, Jim weighs 170 pounds, and his wife weighs 130 pounds. When they are on the scale together, they weigh 292 pounds. By how much is the scale off?</li>
        <li>You begin to fill a bucket with water at 9 am. Each minute you double the amount of water in the bucket. If it takes you 1 hour to fill the bucket, at what time is the bucket one-quarter full?</li>
      <p>Write your answers to these questions with an explanation of your solution, save them as a PDF, and upload the PDF to Dropbox on eCourseware.</p>
      </ol>

      <h3>Solution</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>50 pounds. The rind and the fruit combined are 1% of the weight (i.e., 1 pound). In order for them to become 2% of the weight, the watermelon needs to weigh only 50 pounds, so 50 pounds need to have evaporated.</li>
        <li>8 pounds. 292 - (Jim's weight + error) = Wife's actual weight. Jim's weight plus the scale error equal 170 pounds. 292 - 170 = 122, so the wife actually weighs 122 pounds, and the scale is off by 8 pounds.</li>
        <li>9:58 am. The bucket is full at 10:00 am. During the minute from 9:59 and 10:00 the amount of water in the bucket doubles from half to full. During the minute from 9:58 to 9:59 the amount of water doubles from one quarter to one half, so the bucket was one-quarter full at 9:58.</li>
