			<h3>Writing Assignment</h3>
			<p>Firms have begun to make all financial transactions (i.e., population data) available to auditors, so that they can review every transaction, instead of sampling. Your assignment is to answer the following question: &ldquo;What are the pros and cons of making this same data available to investors, instead of the more traditional summary financial statements, and which report form (population data or summary reports) would you recommend?&rdquo;  Before answering this question, read the HW Article on the course portal; then draft a one-page, single-spaced memo with your answer. Your memo should have proper header and be at least 500 words in length. Save your memo as a PDF, and upload it to Dropbox on eCourseware.</p>
