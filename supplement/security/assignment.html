      <h3>Writing Assignment</h3>
      <p>Firms have begun to make all financial transactions (i.e., population data instead of sampling data) available to auditors, so that they can review every transaction. Your assignment is to answer the following question: &ldquo;What are the pros and cons of making population data of financial transactions available to investors, instead of the more traditional summary financial statements, and which report form (population data or summary reports) would you recommend?&rdquo;  Before answering this question, read <a href="acch-51065.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener" aria-label="PDF opens in new window">Consequences of Big Data and Formalization on Accounting and Auditing Standards</a>. (Clicking the link opens the article in a new window.). Draft a one-page, single-spaced memo with your answer. Your memo should have proper header and be at least 500 words in length. Save your memo as a PDF, and upload it to Dropbox on eCourseware.</p>
