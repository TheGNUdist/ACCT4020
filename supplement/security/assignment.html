			<h3>Control Assignment</h3>
			<p>Firms have begun to make the database of all financial transactions (i.e., population data) available to auditors, so that they can review every transaction, instead of sampling. One of the required readings is an academic research paper proposing changes to filing requirements to make this same data available to investors, as well. Your assignment is to read this paper and write a one-page, single-spaced memo that answers the following question: &ldquo;What are the pros and cons of making this same data available to investors, instead of the more traditional summary financial statements, and which report form (population data or summary reports) would you recommend?&rdquo; Your memo should have proper header and be at least 400 words in length.</p>
