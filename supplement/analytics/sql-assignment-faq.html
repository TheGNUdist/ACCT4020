			<h3>Frequently Asked Questions - Page 1</h3>
			<ol style="font-size: 32px">
				<li>Q: I never received a prompt to set the root password when I installed MySQL. What is the password?<br><i>A: You never received a prompt because the terminal window was too small during the installation process. As a result, the root user has no password, and you can access your database with the command: &ldquo;mysql -uroot&rdquo; (without quotes).</i></li>
				<li>Q: When I try to log in to the database, I receive the error: &ldquo;Access denied for user &lsquo;root&rsquo;@&lsquo;localhost&rsquo;.&rdquo; What should I do?<br><i>A: You must prepend sudo to your mysql command: sudo mysql -uroot (if the root user has no password) or sudo mysql -uroot -p (if the root user has a password). If you continue to have this error after adding sudo, then you have entered the wrong password.</i></li>

				<li>Q: When I try to log in to the database, I receive the error: &ldquo;Can't connect to local MySQL server through socket &lsquo;/var/mysql/mysql.sock&rsquo;&rdquo; What should I do?<br><i>A: This error means that the database server has not started. First, try restarting the virtual machine. If that fails to resolve this issue, then you must uninstall and reinstall MySQL.</i></li>
				<li>Q: What is my password?<br><i>A: Contrary to popular opinion, I cannot answer <em>all</em> technical questions, and I can definitely not tell you what password you set while installing MySQL. If you believe that you have not set a password during install, then please consult question (2).</i></li>
