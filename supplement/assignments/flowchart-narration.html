      <h3>Writing Assignment</h3>
      <p>The lecture slides contain a number of diagrams depicting business processes with narratives explaining the diagrammed processes. This assignment will give you similar experience in reading, interpreting, and communicating the business process in a flowchart. You will find the flowchart for this assignment on the next screen. Pretend that you have received this flowchart from a client and that your manager has asked you to read it and provide her with an email with the narration of the process. Your email should explain which agent performs which task(s) in which order. (NB: Data flow does not always indicate control flow.) I will grade your submission on its accuracy in explaining the diagrammed process, as well as proper spelling and grammar and professional tone. Write your email in a word processor, export it to PDF, and upload it to Dropbox on eCourseware.</p>
