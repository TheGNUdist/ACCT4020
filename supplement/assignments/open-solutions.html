      <h3>Open Solutions - Intro</h3>
      <p>The technology and business world rely on all sorts of open standards, open formats, and open source software. Many more individuals would likely use these open solutions to everyday computing needs, if they were aware of them. This assignment will give you practice in searching for open solutions. On the next screen are a list of demands. Each demand asks for an open source software application or an open format. For each demand, you should research, find, and recommend the best solution or solutions. Depending on the question, you may also need to identify the software license that the application uses. Create a document listing your response to each demand, export the document to PDF, and upload it to Dropbox on eCourseware. I will grade you on your accuracy in finding open solutions.</p>
