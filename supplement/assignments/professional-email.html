      <h3>Professional Email</h3>
      <p>Professional emails are an important part of communication. For this assignment, you will write an email to me with proper salutation and closing and a body with two paragraphs. In the first, please introduce yourself and share something about your background, your goals, etc. In the second, please explain what you hope to get out of this course, how I can support you in achieving your goal, and what you will do to achieve that goal. You will not send the email to my email address, instead you should write it in a word processor, such as Microsoft Word, export it to PDF, and upload it to Dropbox on eCourseware. (If you have not yet learned how to export a Word document to PDF, <a href="http://lmgtfy.com/?iie=1&q=how+to+export+a+Word+document+to+PDF" target="_blank" aria-label="Website opens in new window">let me Google that for you</a>.)</p>
