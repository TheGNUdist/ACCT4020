      <h3>FERPA Tutorial</h3>
      <p>With an increase in data volume, privacy concerns have surfaced. Who should be allowed to collect and analyze this data? How can firms and individuals protect personal data from breaches? Is it legal and ethical for firms to know so much about consumers? Few regulations exist governing the use of consumer data, but in education, the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA) protects the privacy of student records. This assignment will give you insight into this law. Click on this link to complete the University of Memphis <a href="https://umwa.memphis.edu/ferpa/main.php" target="_blank" rel="noopener" aria-label="Website opens in new window">FERPA training</a>. You will need to log in using your University of Memphis credentials. Once you have completed the training, print the confirmation email to PDF, and upload it to Dropbox on eCourseware.</p>
