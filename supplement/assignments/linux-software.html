      <h3>Linux Software</h3>
      <p>This assignment will give you experience working with your own installation of Linux. Begin by creating an online Linux container:
      <ol>
        <li>Create an account with <a href="https://codeanywhere.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" aria-label="Website opens in new window">Codeanywhere</a>.</li>
        <li>Open the verification email and click on the link to verify your email address.</li>
        <li>If the Connection Wizard does not open automatically, from the main Codeanywhere screen, click File - New Connection - Container to open the Connection Wizard to create a new container.</li>
        <li>Name the container your first and last name (e.g., ProfessorCoyne).</li>
        <li>From the list of containers, select Blank - Blank Development Stack - Ubuntu 16.04, and click Create. This deploys the Linux operating system environment that you will use for the tasks on the next screens and for several other homework assignments for the remainder of this course:</li>
      </ol>
    </section>

      <h3>Instructions</h3>
      <p>Once the container is deployed, right click on the container name and select Turn On. (Because Codeanywhere has just deployed this new container, it may already be on.) Right click on the container name, and select SSH Terminal to connect to your Linux environment's text-based shell. Using that shell, complete each task listed on the next screen. For each task, identify the command necessary to complete the task. Run the command in your Linux shell, and take a screenshot after executing each command. Each screenshot must show your container name. (If you have not learned how to take a screenshot, let me Google that for you: <a href="http://lmgtfy.com/?iie=0&q=how+to+take+a+screenshot+on+windows" target="_blank" aria-label="Website opens in new window">Windows</a>, <a href="http://lmgtfy.com/?iie=0&q=how+to+take+a+screenshot+on+mac" target="_blank" aria-label="Website opens in new window">macOS</a>, <a href="http://lmgtfy.com/?iie=0&q=how+to+take+a+screenshot+on+chromeos" target="_blank" aria-label="Website opens in new window">Chrome OS</a>.) Create a word processor document and paste each screenshot into that document. Beneath each screenshot in the document, type the task number and the Linux command used to complete the task. Export the document to PDF and upload it to Dropbox on eCourseware.</p>

      <h3>Commands - Page 1 of 2</h3>
      <p>(NB: Some commands require additional user input after executing the initial command. Accept all changes with &lsquo;y&rsquo; or hitting ENTER. Also, if any command returns a &ldquo;Could not get lock&rdquo; error, then right click on your container name and restart your container before retrying the command.)</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Update the repository list.</li>
        <li>Upgrade all installed software packages to their newest versions.</li>
        <li>Determine whether the application containing the nano command is installed.</li>
        <li>If nano is not installed, install the nano package.</li>
        <li>Search for a package name using the search terms "talking cow" (without quotes).</li>
        <li>Install the package from the previous step (NB: Not the package with graphical cows).</li>
      </ol>

      <h3>Commands - Page 2 of 2</h3>
      <ol start="7">
        <li>The package name and the command name are the same, open the manual page for the command installed in the previous step (NB: Exit the manual page by typing q).
        <li>Search for a package name using the search terms "data files containing fortune cookies" (without quotes).</li>
        <li>Install the package from the previous step (NB: Not the packages with Italian or other foreign language cookies, selected fortune cookies, or offensive fortune cookies).</li>
        <li>The package name and the command name are almost the same, except that the command name does not end in an &lsquo;s.&rsquo; Using the UNIX philosophy, pipe the output from this command to the command installed in step 6.</li>
        <li>Uninstall the applications installed in steps 6 and 9.</li>
      </ol>
