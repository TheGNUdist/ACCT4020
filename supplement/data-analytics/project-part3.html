      <h3>Project Part 3 - Intro</h3>
      <p>Part 3 of this project tests your ability to query a database to analyze data. Your assignment is to identify the <em>queries</em> necessary to find the answers. In part 1 of this project, you already installed MySQL Server and imported a database. If you have not completed part 1 of this project, then you will not be able to complete part 3, and you should review the instructions for part 1 of this project in order to install MySQL and import the database for this project. For part 3 of this project, you will use that database server and database to run SQL queries.</p>
      <p>Take a screenshot of as much of the output of each query as possible, and paste each screenshot into a single document along with the query used to create the output. Each screenshot must display your container name. Export the document to PDF, and upload it to Dropbox on eCourseware. I will grade solely on the accuracy of the queries.</p>

      <h3>Tips</h3>
        <p>Begin each question by looking at the Dictionary file on the course portal for a definition of the necessary tables and their attributes. Before considering SQL syntax, think logically about what you want to know. This will help you to determine which attributes to select (e.g., Do I need ID or PO?), which summary functions may be necessary (e.g., Do I need to add values from multiple records or count the number of records?), and how to limit the results to records that match all question criteria (e.g., Do I only need orders from a single day?)</p>

      <h3>Questions</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>(PAYMENT table) Which payment ID(s) have no purchase order number?</li>
        <li>(VENDOR table) How many vendors are located in Texas?</li>
        <li>(SALE table) What is total sales revenue? (Revenue is unit price times quantity less the savings from a promotional or discount rate.)</li>
        <li>(EMPLOYEE table) How many employees work at each location? (You should generate one query that reports one number for each location.)</li>
        <li>(PAYMENT table) Which invoices have multiple payments?</li>
        <li>(INVOICE and EMPLOYEE table) Which employees processed invoices? (Your query should report employee name without any duplicates.) 
        <li>(RECEIPT and PURCHASE tables) Which, if any, receipt(s) have a different quantity of raw materials delivered than were ordered in the purchase order?</li>
        <li>(SALE table) Which customer(s) placed the most expensive order?</li>
