			<h3>SQL Assignment - Intro</h3>
			<p>This assignment tests your ability to query a database to find the answers to four question. You will use the Company database on the course portal, but your assignment is <strong>not</strong> to find the <em>answers</em> to the four questions, but rather to identify the <em>queries</em> necessary to find the answers. Stated otherwise, this assignment asks four questions (on the next slide). Using MySQL on your Linux container, you should determine the query that you would use to determine the answer to each question. Once you have identified the correct queries, create a document with the queries, save the document as a PDF, and upload it to Dropbox on eCourseware. I will grade solely on the accuracy of the queries.</p>
