			<h3>SQL Assignment - Intro</h3>
			<p>This assignment tests your ability to query a database to find the answers to four question. You will use the Company database on the course portal, but your assignment is <strong>not</strong> to find the <em>answers</em> to the four questions, but rather to identify the <em>queries</em> necessary to find the answers. Stated otherwise, this assignment asks four questions (on the next slide), and the online homework quiz, by which you will submit your solution, asks the same questions. You should not enter the answers to the questions in the quiz, rather you should enter the SQL query you would use to determine the answer. Before completing the quiz, you should verify the accuracy of your queries using your Linux environment.</p>
