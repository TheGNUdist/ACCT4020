      <h3>Practice</h3>
      <p>This assignment tests your ability to query a database to analyze data. Your assignment is <strong>not</strong> to find the <em>answers</em> to questions, but rather to identify the <em>queries</em> necessary to find the answers. Following these steps, you should identify the queries to answer the questions:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Use apt to install mysql-server on your Linux container</li>
        <li>Import the Database file into MySQL</li>
        <li>Launch the MySQL client to run SQL queries</li>
      </ol>
      <p>Take a screenshot of as much of the output of each query as possible, and paste each screenshot into a single document along with the query used to create the output. Export the document to PDF, and upload it to Dropbox on eCourseware. I will grade solely on the accuracy of the queries. The questions are listed on the next screen:</p>

      <h3>Questions</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>(PAYMENT table) Which payment ID has no purchase order number?</li>
        <li>(SALE table) What is total sales revenue for the current period?</li>
        <li>(EMPLOYEE table) How many employees work at each location? (Your query should report one number for each location.)</li>
        <li>(RECEIPT and PURCHASE tables) Which, if any, receipt has a different number of raw materials delivered than were ordered in the purchase order?</li>
        <li>(SALE table) Which customer(s) placed the largest single orders?</li>
      </ol>
