			<h3>Practice</h3>
			<p>This assignment tests your ability to query a database to analyze data. Your assignment is <strong>not</strong> to find the <em>answers</em> to questions, but rather to identify the <em>queries</em> necessary to find the answers. Following these steps, you should identify the queries to answer the questions:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>Use apt to install mysql-server on your Linux container</li>
				<li>Import the Database file into MySQL</li>
				<li>Launch the MySQL client to run SQL queries</li>
			</ol>
			<p>take a screenshot of the output of each query, and paste them into a document along with the query used to create the output. Export the document to PDF, and upload it to Dropbox on eCourseware. I will grade solely on the accuracy of the queries. The questions are listed on the next screen:</p>

			<h3>Questions</h3>
			<ol>
				<li>What is the first and last name of the employee with the social security number 333445555?</li>
				<li>What is the total number of hours logged in the WORKS_ON table?</li>
				<li>What is the total number of hours worked on each project by project number? (Your query should report one record for each project number.)</li>
				<li>Which employees work in the Research department? (Your query must include the statement "WHERE DEPARTMENT.DNAME = RESEARCH".)</li>
			</ol>
