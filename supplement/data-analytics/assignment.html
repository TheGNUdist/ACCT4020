			<h3>SQL Assignment - Intro</h3>
			<p>This assignment tests your ability to query a database to find the answers to four question. You will use the Company database on the course portal, but your assignment is <strong>not</strong> to find the <em>answers</em> to the four questions, but rather to identify the <em>queries</em> necessary to find the answers. Stated otherwise, this assignment asks four questions (on the next slide), and the online homework quiz, by which you will submit your solution, asks the same questions. You should not enter the answers to the questions in the quiz, rather you should enter the SQL query you would use to determine the answer. Before completing the quiz, you should verify the accuracy of your queries using your Linux environment.</p>

			<h3>Queries</h3>
			<ol>
				<li>What is the total number of hours logged in the WORKS_ON table?</li>
				<li>How many employees work in the Research department? (You may not hardcode the department number in your query.)</li>
				<li>What is the total number of hours worked on each project by project name? (Your query should report one number for each project.)</li>
				<li>Which employees are supervisors? (List first, middle initial, and last name. You may not hardcode the Ssn in your query, and the query must print each name only once.)</li>
			</ol>
