      <h3>Interactive &amp; Writing Assignment</h3>
      <p>Computer hardware enables you to do your job, but when hardware becomes outdated, it may no longer be able to meet the demands you place on it. When this happens, it is time to upgrade. In order to convince your employer to purchase a new computer, you need to explain what hardware your current computer has, what hardware your desired computer has, and how the hardware in your desired computer will improve your productivity. For this assignment, you will draft an email to the IT department of your hypothetical employer requesting a new computer. Your description of your computer and the desired replacement computer should include CPU model, word length, number of cores, clock speed, RAM capacity, and storage type and capacity. I will grade your submission on completeness, spelling, grammar, and professional tone. Write the email in a word processor, export it to PDF, and upload it to Dropbox on eCourseware.</p>
