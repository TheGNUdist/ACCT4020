      <h3>Practice &amp; Writing Assignment</h3>
      <p>In this assignment, you will compare computers by their hardware. First, discover what hardware your own computing device (desktop, laptop, or mobile device) has. You may need to research the specific hardware model online to learn what hardware it has, or your operating system may be able to report the computer's hardware. Next, research the hardware makeup of replacement device. Draft a memo with proper header to the purchasing department to explain what computer you have, what computer you want, and how the replacement device will make your job easier. Your description of your computer and the replacement computer should include CPU model, word length, number of cores, clock speed, RAM capacity, and storage type and capacity. Print your memo to PDF and upload it to Dropbox on eCourseware.</p>
