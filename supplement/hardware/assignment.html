			<h3>Hardware Assignment</h3>
			<p>For decades, a personal computer was a laptop or a desktop. Today, several alternative computing devices have surfaced. The most popular of these are smartphones and tablets, but others, such as the family of Chromebooks and the family of Raspberry Pis, have also arisen and taken the computing world by storm. Your assignment is to select one alternative computing device that is not an Apple or Android device and write a one-page, single-spaced memo describing (1) the device you have chosen, including CPU and RAM specs; (2) how it could replace your current computer; and (3) what difficulties you would face switching to this new device. (For this last point, I expect observations that are better informed than, &ldquo;It will not run Microsoft Office.&rdquo;) Your memo should have a proper header and be at least 400 words.</p>
