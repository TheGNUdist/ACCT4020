      <h3>Practice &amp; Writing Assignment</h3>
      <p>Whether you use a workstation, a laptop, or a mobile device, computer hardware enables you to do your job. When hardware becomes outdated, it may no longer be able to meet demands your job responsibilities place on it. When this happens, it is time to upgrade to new computer hardware. In order to convince your employer's IT department to purchase a new computer, you need to explain what hardware your current computer has, what hardware your desired computer has, and how the hardware in your desired computer will improve your productivity. For this assignment, you will draft an email to the IT department requesting a new computer. Your description of your computer and the desired replacement computer should include CPU model, word length, number of cores, clock speed, RAM capacity, and storage type and capacity. Write the email in a word processor, export it to PDF, and upload it to Dropbox on eCourseware.</p>
