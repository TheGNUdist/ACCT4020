			<h3>Reflection Assignment</h3>
			<p>This course is likely very different from what you had expected. In the past, several students have made it far into the semester thinking, &ldquo;This seems more like an MIS course,&rdquo; or, &ldquo;I thought that this would be about accounting.&rdquo; Your assignment is to read the PWC white paper and the article on collaboration from the required readings and to write a one-page, single-spaced memo to yourself explaining how this course will help you become a stronger accountant. The purpose of this assignment is to encourage you to internalize what you have already learned in the first two weeks of this course about the nature of the course. The majority of the content that you will draw on for this reflection would be the course description in the syllabus and this week's lecture. Your memo should have proper header and be at least 500 words.</p>
