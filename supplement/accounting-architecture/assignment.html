      <h3>Writing Assignment</h3>
      <p>The purpose of the course is to set you apart from other accounting graduates by giving you a greater understanding of business data and information technology. This assignment will have you practice communicating what you learn and how it makes you a superior job candidate to a future employer. Write a professional cover email for your desired accounting position. Follow the format of the sample cover letter in the Professionalism lecture. Focus the letter on what you learn in this course as if you had already completed this course. Keep your cover letter brief and to the point. If you use the term &ldquo;accounting architecture,&rdquo; you must explain what it means. However, it is not necessary to use that term; you may reference the principles of accounting architecture without using the term itself. Write your cover email in a word processor, export it to PDF, and upload it to Dropbox on eCourseware.</p>
