			<h3>Writing Assignment</h3>
			<p>This course is likely very different from what you had expected. In the past, students have made it far into the semester thinking, &ldquo;This seems more like an MIS course,&rdquo; or, &ldquo;I thought that this would be about accounting.&rdquo; I try to dispel any misconceptions as early as possible by showing why accounting architecture is important to accountants. Similarly, when interviewing with a future employer, you should be able to communicate why what you have learned at school is important. For this assignment, write a one-page, single-spaced memo explaining what accounting architecture is and how it will make you a better employee and a stronger accountant. Your memo should have a proper header (i.e., To:, From:, Date:, and Subject:) and be at least 500 words. Save your memo as a PDF, and upload it to Dropbox on eCourseware.</p>
