      <h3>Practice - Intro</h3>
      <p>This assignment will give you experience working with your own installation of Linux. Begin by creating an online Linux container:
      <ol>
        <li>Create a free account with <a href="https://codeanywhere.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" aria-label="Website opens in new window">Codeanywhere</a>.</li>
        <li>Open the verification email and click on the link to verify your email address.</li>
        <li>If the Connection Wizard does not open automatically, from the main Codeanywhere screen, click File - New Connection - Container to open the Connection Wizard to create a new container.</li>
        <li>Name the container your first and last name (e.g., ProfessorCoyne).</li>
        <li>From the list of containers, select Blank - Blank Development Stack - Ubuntu 14.04, and click Create. This deploys the Linux operating system environment that you will use for the tasks on the next screens and for several other homework assignments for the remainder of this course:</li>
      </ol>

      <p>Once the container is deployed, right click on the container name and select Turn On. (Because Codeanywhere has just deployed this new container, it may already be on.) While your container is running, right click on the container name, and select SSH Terminal to connect to your Linux environment's text-based shell. Using that shell, complete each task listed on the next screen. For each task, identify the command necessary to complete the task. Run the command in your Linux shell, and take a screenshot after executing each command. (If you have not learned how to take a screenshot, let me Google that for you: <a href="http://lmgtfy.com/?iie=0&q=how+to+take+a+screenshot+on+windows" target="_blank" aria-label="Website opens in new window">Windows</a>, <a href="http://lmgtfy.com/?iie=0&q=how+to+take+a+screenshot+on+mac" target="_blank" aria-label="Website opens in new window">macOS</a>, <a href="http://lmgtfy.com/?iie=0&q=how+to+take+a+screenshot+on+chromeos" target="_blank" aria-label="Website opens in new window">Chrome OS</a>.) Create a word processor document and paste each screenshot into that document. Beneath each screenshot in the document, type the task number and the Linux command used to complete the task. Export the document to PDF and upload it to Dropbox on eCourseware.</p>

      <p>(NB: Some commands require additional user input after executing the initial command. Answer all questions with &lsquo;y.&rsquo; Also, if any command returns a &ldquo;Could not get lock&rdquo; error, then right click on your container name and restart your container before retrying the command.)</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Update the repository list.</li>
        <li>Upgrade all installed software to their newest versions.</li>
        <li>Install the package named dialog.</li>
        <li>Install the package named man-db.</li>
        <li>Search for the package name of the application Midnight Commander.</li>
        <li>Install Midnight Commander using the package name found in the previous step. (Hint: Do not install the data files package or debug package.)</li>
        <li>Uninstall Midnight Commander.</li>
      </ol>
