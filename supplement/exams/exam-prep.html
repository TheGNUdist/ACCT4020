      <h3>Exam Prep - Intro</h3>
      <p>The final exam for this course will test your ability to use a Linux container to (1) install and maintain software, (2) create and manipulate files and folders, and (3) manage servers. The final exam will provide you with a series of tasks. For each task, use your Linux container to identify the correct command to complete the task. This exam prep provides mock exam tasks so that you can practice working with a Linux container in preparation for the final exam. You will not submit anything for the mock exam; it is solely for practice. If you do not know how to complete a task, you should look to the course materials for help; you should not use any other online resource (e.g., Google) because no online resource other than course materials will be available to you during the exam. This prep has 20 tasks, but the final exam will include 25, including some tasks based on the projects from this course.</p>
