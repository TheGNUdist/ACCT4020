			<h3>Open Source Assignment</h3>
			<p>Perhaps the two most significant hurdles preventing wider acceptance of open source software are (1) a lack of visibility (i.e., people are either unaware of it) and (2) the current level of comfort with proprietary software (i.e., people are familiar with a proprietary solution and feel no need to investigate an alternative). This assignment addresses both. Select a software that you use and research online whether it is open source. If it is open source, then complete the online quiz with the name of the open source software and leave the field for proprietary software blank. If the software is proprietary, then find an open source alternative and complete the online quiz with the names of the proprietary software and the open source alternative.</p>
