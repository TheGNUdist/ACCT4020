			<h3>Open Source Assignment - Intro</h3>
			<p>Perhaps the two most significant hurdles preventing wider acceptance of open source software are (1) a lack of visibility (i.e., people are either unaware that it exists or are unaware that the software they use is open source) and (2) the current level of comfort with proprietary software (i.e., people are familiar with a proprietary solution and feel no need to investigate an alternative). Because open source software is so prominent in systems development, any participants must have overcome these two hurdles. The assignment described on page 2 will help you to overcome both.

			<p>First, select any computing task that you might perform. The task should not reference a specific software (e.g., listen to music, not listen to iTunes). Second, identify the software you would most likely use to complete the task and determine whether it is open source. If the software is open source, select a proprietary alternative, compare them and explain why you prefer your open source solution. If the software is proprietary, select an open source alternative, compare them and explain whether the open source alternative would be suitable. You may wish to install and experiment with the alternative software, but regardless, you should also use online reviews, comments, and forums to help you form an opinion about the perceived strengths and weaknesses of the software that you compare. Write a thoughtful response as a one-page, single-spaced memo with a proper header and at least 400 words.</p>
