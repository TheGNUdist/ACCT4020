			<h3>Professionalism Assignment - Intro</h3>
			<p>Professional emails are an important part of communication. The current culture of writing single line emails as if they were text messages is not professional, nor is it appropriate for this course nor for any email in a professional setting. In order to demonstrate this principle, you will write a professional email to me. You will not send the email to my email address, instead you should write it in a word processor, such as Microsoft Word, and save it as a PDF and upload it to Dropbox on eCourseware. (If you have not yet learned how to export a Word document to PDF, <a href="http://lmgtfy.com/?iie=1&q=how+to+export+a+Word+document+to+PDF" target="_blank" aria-label="Website opens in new window">let me Google that for you</a>. Your email should have the components listed on the next page.</p>

			<h3>Email Components</h3>
			<ol>
				<li><u>Proper address</u>: &ldquo;Dear Professor&rdquo; or &ldquo;Dear Sir&rdquo;</li>
				<li><u>Body</u>: The email body should have at least two paragraphs. In the first, please introduce yourself and share something about your background, your goals, etc. In the second, you should describe your commitment to professionalism throughout your professional life.</li>
				<li><u>Signature block</u>: It is not necessary to include a closing, such as &ldquo;Sincerely,&rdquo; but your signature should have your own title (e.g., Mr., Ms., or another appropriate title), your first name or the name you go by, and your last name.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>You should use this setup for <em>all</em> emails during this course, not simply for this assignment.</p>
