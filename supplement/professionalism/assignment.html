      <h3>Writing Assignment</h3>
      <p>Professional emails are an important part of communication. For this assignment, you will write an email with proper salutation and closing and a body with two paragraphs. In the first, please introduce yourself and share something about your background, your goals, etc. In the second, summarize in your own words one principle from this week's reading on the book <u>How Will You Measure Your Life</u> and explain how you will incorporate that principle in your life to improve your professionalism. You will not send the email to my email address, instead you should write it in a word processor, such as Microsoft Word, export it to PDF, and upload it to Dropbox on eCourseware. (If you have not yet learned how to export a Word document to PDF, <a href="http://lmgtfy.com/?iie=1&q=how+to+export+a+Word+document+to+PDF" target="_blank" aria-label="Website opens in new window">let me Google that for you</a>.) I will grade your emails based on grammar, spelling, completeness, and professionalism.</p>
