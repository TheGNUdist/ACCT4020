			<h3>Writing Assignment</h3>
			<p>The lecture slides contain a number of diagrams depicting business processes with narratives explaining the diagrammed processes. The purpose of this assignment is to give you similar experience in reading and interpreting flowcharts. You will find two flowcharts on the course portal. Your assignment is to write in your own words a narrative explaining the process that each flowchart depicts. This assignment has no formatting requirement. I will grade your submission on its accuracy in explaining the diagrammed processes, as well as proper spelling and grammar. Save your submission as a PDF, and upload it to Dropbox on eCourseware.</p>

			<h3>Solution: Payment Process</h3>
			<p>The mail room receives an invoice from the vendor and forwards it to the purchasing department. The purchasing department compares the invoice with the information from the purchase order (i.e., what the company ordered) from the purchase order database and the receiving report (i.e., what the company received) from the receiving report database. If the three disagree, the purchasing department returns the invoice to the vendor. If they agree, the purchasing department adds the invoice to the invoice database, files the paper copy, and notifies the cashier. The cashier prepares the check, updates the cash payments journal, and sends the check to the vendor. Accounts payable uses the information from the cash payments journal to update the A/P subledger.</p>

			<h3>Solution: Sales Order Process</h3>
			<p>The sales department receives a sales order from the customer. If the order is on credit, the then credit department performs a credit check using customer and A/R information. If credit is denied or if the sales is not on credit, payment is requested. If payment is not received, the order is cancelled. If credit is approved or payment received, the sales order is approved. Sales notifies the customer of the order status. The warehouse verifies that the inventory is available. If necessary, the warehouse modifies the order and notifies the customer. The warehouse then fills the order and prepares a packing slip. The shipping department delivers the packing slip and goods to the carrier, marks the order as complete, and notifies the customer. The inventory and A/R agents then update inventory and A/R records, respectively.</p>
