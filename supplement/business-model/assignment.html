			<h3>Writing Assignment</h3>
			<p>The lecture slides contain a number of diagrams depicting business processes with narratives explaining the diagrammed processes. The purpose of this assignment is to give you similar experience in reading and interpreting flowcharts. You will find two flowcharts on the course portal. Your assignment is to write in your own words a narrative explaining the process that each flowchart depicts. This assignment has no formatting requirement. I will grade your submission on its accuracy in explaining the diagrammed processes, as well as proper spelling and grammar. Save your submission as a PDF, and upload it to Dropbox on eCourseware.</p>
