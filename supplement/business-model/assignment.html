      <h3>Writing Assignment</h3>
      <p>The lecture slides contain a number of diagrams depicting business processes with narratives explaining the diagrammed processes. The purpose of this assignment is to give you similar experience in reading and interpreting the flowchart displayed on the next slide. Your assignment is to write a memo with a narrative explaining the process in the flowchart in your own words. You should write your memo as if you were explaining this process to a accounting supervisor, so you should make explanation as clear and professional as possible. Your memo should also have a proper header. I will grade your submission on its accuracy in explaining the diagrammed processes, as well as proper spelling and grammar and professional tone. Save your memo as a PDF, and upload it to Dropbox on eCourseware.</p>
