      <h2>Course Overview</h2>
      <p>This course explains how to become a <strong>professional</strong> <strong>accounting</strong> <strong>architect</strong>. Because you already know <strong>accounting</strong>, this course will focus on the other two components. The <strong>architecture</strong> section of the course is an introduction to (1) the information life cycle, (2) information technology, and (3) IT controls from the perspective of an accountant, and the small <strong>professionalism</strong> section will address how to be a professional.</p>
      <p>This is not a course on accounting regulations. Financial accounting, audit, and tax fill those needs. This is not a course on calculating costs and revenues. That is for management accounting. This is also not a course on small business accounting software. All of those topics are relevant and valuable, but they are not the purpose of this course. This course will teach you about enterprise-grade information systems, information technology, and cyber-security. All accounting information comes from an information system, and as custodians of that information, it is the responsibility of accountants to understand and interact with these systems.</p>
      <p>As a result, this will feel like a technology course, instead of an accounting course. That is not by accident. Understanding how firms maintain their accounting data is not about memorizing the debits and credits of journal entries. It is about (1) knowing the steps to convert raw data into information, (2) understanding the necessary technologies, and (3) knowing how to preserve data integrity and information security.</p>
      <p>This is not an easy course. The topics we will discuss will be new to most students, and the assignments will be difficult. Again, that is not by accident. In order to open your mind to the world of information systems, you will need to jump in and get your hands dirty. You should expect to spend between five and seven hours each week reading materials and completing assignments.</p>
      <p>You may ask why this course is structured this way. Many accounting courses rely on published textbooks and publisher-provided slide presentations and exams. In the past, this course has also used those materials. It would be more convenient for me to follow this pattern, but I choose not to. Instead, I have spent countless hours creating my own lectures and assignments and curating reading materials for two reasons. First, <em>your</em> future employers have demanded that you acquire skills in information technology and data analytics. Second, I want your skills in these areas to be better than anyone else's. You may not aspire to having IT skills, but this is the future of the accounting profession. Regardless of whether you like this course, I guarantee that this will not be one of those courses, in which you will not learn anything. If you work, you <em>will</em> learn, and it will be worth it.</p>
      </div>

      <h3>Pre-requisites:</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>ACCT 3110 - Intermediate Accounting I</li>
        <li>ACCT 3310 - Cost Accounting</li>
      </ul>
      <p>A solid understanding of both financial and managerial accounting are valuable for this course for two reasons. First, a required practice set assignment will test your understanding of financial accounting concepts. Second, in order to understand the usefulness of an information system, it is vital to understand an organization's informational needs, and many of those needs come from financial and managerial accounting. Other information and control needs com from the tax and audit functions, and although not required, having already taken a course in taxation and a course in auditing would also be valuable preparation for this course.</p>

      </ul>
      <h4>Course Portal</h4>
      <p>The course portal provides access to all learning materials for this course. I have written the course portal to be accessible via desktop, laptop, and mobile device. The materials on the course portal are grouped by topic. Topics usually span one week; however, some weeks have multiple topics. Each topic will contain one or more of the following items:</p>
      <dl>
        <dt>Lecture</dt>
          <dd>The lectures are required reading and the foundation for each new topic. This course has no textbook. The decision to avoid using a textbook is primarily to save you money&mdash;you're welcome&mdash;but also because the issues we address constantly change, and a textbook would quickly be out-of-date. Instead, I have written a series of lectures that provide the foundational content for each topic. The lectures are in slide format. I have gone to great lengths to make these slides thorough and readable. The slides are not in PowerPoint format, but rather are specially designed Web pages, readily viewable on any device. In order to navigate the slide deck, use the arrow keys on a keyboard, click with a mouse, or swipe horizontally on a touchscreen. You may also print the slides, if you wish. After opening a lecture, append <span class="code">?print-pdf</span> to the end of the lecture URL, and reload the page. This will allow you to print a slide per page. Depending on your printer settings, you may also be able to print multiple slides per page.</dd>
        <dt>Article</dt>
          <dd>Although I have tried to write thorough lectures, I have also tried to keep the lectures concise. As a result, the lectures will never give exhaustive treatment to any topic. In order to supplement the content in these lectures, I have identified additional articles that either extend the principles from the lecture or give examples of real-world implementation. All articles are also required readings.</dd>
        <dt>Homework</dt>
          <dd>Although knowledge of the material in the lectures and articles is important, that knowledge is not enough. The value of technology is in the ability to use it, and the only way to learn to use it is to practice. Furthermore, the role of accountants is to collaborate with and provide information to other business functions. In addition to IT knowledge, this requires communication skills. Each week you will have one or more homework assignments designed to provide experience with enterprise-grade IT tools or to reinforce your communication skills.</dd>
        <dt>Tutorial</dt>
          <dd>Lecture slides are useful for explaining topics, but they are not as useful for showing technologies in action. Because several assignments involve using technologies that are new to most students, I provide video tutorials as an additional help towards completing some assignments.</dd>
        <dt>Puzzle</dt>
          <dd>Puzzles are exercises that are designed to get the mental juices flowing before reading a lecture. They are completely optional, but I will award a small amount of extra credit for each correct solution. Each puzzle has a separate Dropbox folder on eCourseware. You can submit your solution in any format you wish (e.g., screenshot, scanned image, photo of a sheet of paper, etc.). However, if I cannot open the file, I will not grade it, so I would advise that you only upload image or PDF files.</dd>
      </dl>
      <p>The Home page of the course portal will display all current and future topics so that you may work ahead, if you choose. The Archive page stores all previous topics. Where applicable, when a topic is archived, I will replace puzzles and assignments with their respective solutions. The course portal also displays a schedule of due dates throughout the semester.</p>
      <h4>eCourseware</h4>
      <p>Although the course materials will be on the course portal, Dropbox folders, quizzes, exams, and grades will be on eCourseware.</p>
      <h4>Practice Set</h4>
      <p>One of the required purchases for this course is an online practice set which costs &dollar;35. See <a href="#practiceset">below</a> for a description of the assignment and instructions for purchasing the practice set.</p>
      <h4>Computer</h4>
      <p>All students must have access to a computer for this course. You may use a mobile device for readings and tutorials, but most assignments will require functionality that is not available on a mobile device. Desktops and laptops running any full operating system, as well as Chromebooks, are sufficient. Lab computers are available on campus for students who have no access to a computer.</p>

      <h3>Course Objectives:</h3>
      <p>The goal of this course is to teach:
      <ul>
        <li>The steps in the information life cycle.</li>
        <li>Common hardware and software components of an enterprise-grade information system.</li>
        <li>IT controls for data security and integrity.</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Fogelman College: Learning Outcomes for Your Degree</h3>
      <p>This course is designed to help you to meet the overall learning objectives for the BBA in Accountancy offered by the Fogelman College. You should take the time to become familiar with these <a href="http://www.fcbeassessment.net/LearningOutcomes/BBADegreeAccountancyLearningOutcomes.pdf" target="_blank" rel=noopener" aria-label="PDF opens in new window">learning objectives</a>.</p>
      <p>This course also addresses the AACSB A7 learning objective to &ldquo;develop skills and knowledge related to the <strong>integration of information technology in accounting and business</strong>. Included in these learning experiences is the development of skills and knowledge related to <strong>data creation, data sharing, data analytics, data mining, data reporting, and storage</strong> within and across organizations.&rdquo;</p>

      <h2>Grading and Evaluation Criteria</h2>
      <h3>Final Grades:</h3>
      <p>I will assign final grades according to the following scale:</p>
      <div class="table bordered">
        <div class="row header centered">
          <div class="cell">Point Range</div><div class="cell">Grade</div>
        </div>
        <div class="row centered">
          <div class="cell">&ge;90</div><div class="cell">A</div>
        </div>
        <div class="row centered">
          <div class="cell">80-89</div><div class="cell">B</div>
        </div>
        <div class="row centered">
          <div class="cell">70-79</div><div class="cell">C</div>
        </div>
        <div class="row centered">
          <div class="cell">60-69</div><div class="cell">D</div>
        </div>
        <div class="row centered">
          <div class="cell">&lt;60</div><div class="cell">F</div>
        </div>
      </div>
      <p>I generally only give whole letter grades. However, in rare cases I will award a plus for superior and a minus for inferior effort within a grade band. I also reserve the right to curve the class upward to award students higher grades, but I will not curve downward.</p>

      <h3>Explanation and Schedule of Deliverables:</h3>
      <p>Please note, multiple deliverables have required file formats (e.g., PDF, PNG) for submission. The decision to submit a file that differs from the required format may result in a grade penalty. Other deviations from assignment instructions will also result in grade penalties.</p>
      <div id="practiceset">
      <h4>Practice Set</h4>
      <p>The online practice set has been designed to provide students with practical bookkeeping experience through the completion of a one month accounting cycle for a fictional business. It is customary for accounting undergraduate students to complete a practice set, but many accounting programs use a paper system. We will use an online system because it will be easier for you and because it reinforces the concepts of information technology in accounting.</p>
      <p>The practice set will provide each student with a unique accounting scenario and therefore must be completed on an individual basis. Submission is to be completed online; however it is possible to print various parts of the practice set for offline calculation. After submitting each section, the practice set will provide immediate performance feedback. Bookmarks will allow you to save your work between submissions. The practice set takes approximately 20 hours to complete.</p>
      <p>The practice set will be due <strong>November 11 @ 23.59</strong>. <em>I will not change the deadline for any reason.</em> Additionally, I have scheduled intermediate milestones to ensure that all students are on track to complete the practice set on time. Each week that a milestone is due, the course portal will report the due date and explain what portion of the practice set to complete. You may work ahead, but failure to complete a milestone <em>on time</em> will result in a 2% penalty against your overall practice set grade for each milestone missed.</p>
      <p>To purchase the practice set:</p>

      </ol>
      <p>Payment can be made by online credit card or PayPal. Payment instructions are provided after registration.</p>
      </div>
      <h4>Quizzes</h4>
      <p>In order to encourage careful reading throughout the semester, a quiz will accompany each topic, including the syllabus and the practice set instructions. Quizzes will be multiple choice and true-false and will cover the lectures and articles. The course portal reports the due date for each quiz. Except for the syllabus and practice set quizzes, all quizzes will be due before the beginning of class on the quiz due date so that you will be prepared for the class discussion. All quizzes will be on eCourseware. I will not reopen any quizzes, and I will not offer any makeup quizzes.</p>
      <h4>Homework</h4>
      <p>Practical experience is more valuable than simply listening to lectures. I will assign several homework assignments throughout the semester to give you the opportunity to practice what you have learned. Depending on the assignment, you will submit a memo, screenshot, diagram, etc., as evidence of your work. These homework assignments may require several hours of work. The course portal reports all homework due dates, and the homework assignment instructions explain how to submit the homework. For the IT-practice assignments, I encourage you to start early enough to be able to troubleshoot any issues you might have before the due date. For the writing assignment, I encourage you to invest the necessary time to allow these assignments to improve your writing skills, whatever level they may currently be. I will grade IT assignments primarily on completion, and I will grade writing assignments on completeness, grammar, spelling, and formatting.</p>
      <h4>Research</h4>
      <p>Course materials and quizzes center around content that I have curated, but I also wish to encourage independent reading and learning. Each student will complete one deliverable to demonstrate independent research:</p>
      <dl>
        <dt>Presentation</dt>
        <dd>Each student will give an individual presentation to the class during the semester. Presentations should be a minimum of 15 minutes long but no longer than 20 minutes on a topic of your choosing that relates to a current technology issue. The topic should not be a reiteration of something already covered in a lecture or an article, but rather it should introduce a new concept or issue. Each presentation day I will ask for volunteers to present the following presentation day, and if any time slots remain, I will assign presenters at random. Students may choose the form of their presentations (e.g., slide deck, hands-on tutorial, video, in-class exercise, etc). Presentations will be graded according to <a href="../presentations/presentation-rubric.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener" aria-label="Website opens in new window">this rubric</a>. Students' overall presentation grades will be based primarily on their own presentations but also on attendance and participation during other presentations.</dd>
      </dl>
      <h4>Participation</h4>
      <p>Classroom learning is a group effort. The more everyone participates, the more everyone learns. Sitting silently during lectures constitutes free riding because that student learns from others without providing anything of value in return. In order to encourage beneficial contributions in class, I base part of your final grade on your in-class participation. I expect all students to attend class each day and actively participate in the discussion.</p>
      <h4>Midterm &amp; Final Exam</h4>
      <p>This course has two exams, one midterm and one final. The course portal reports both exam dates. The exams will be similar to the quizzes, and they will be administered through eCourseware. The final exam will be comprehensive, and it will be due <strong>December 13 @ 12.00 (noon)</strong> according to the Registrar's <a href="http://www.memphis.edu/registrar/calendars/index.php" target="_blank" rel="noopener" aria-label="Website opens in new window">Academic Calendar</a>.</p>

      <h2>Course Policies</h2>
      <h3>E-Mail:</h3>
      <p>E-mail to my University of Memphis e-mail address is how you may communicate with me. You should not, under any circumstances, use eCourseware's email function. I will communicate using e-mail, as well, and I will always try to respond to email within 24 hours. However, I will not respond to emails on weekends. Instead, I will answer emails sent on Saturday and Sunday by Monday. I will also not respond to emails about assignments on the day that the assignment is due because this would encourage students to wait until the last minute to begin working assignments. Furthermore, I will not respond to emails requesting that the deadline for a deliverable be changed. Finally, I expect all students to draft professional emails when communicating with me, and I reserve the right not to respond to an unprofessional email.</p>

      <h3>Attendance:</h3>
      <p>For University of Memphis attendance policies including guidelines for adding or dropping classes, please reference the Undergraduate Catalog's document on <a href="http://www.memphis.edu/ugcatalog/acad_reg/attendance.php" target="_blank" rel="noopener" aria-label="Website opens in new window">Class Attendance</a>. I will not take attendance, but attendance is part of your Participation and Research grades.</p>

      <div id="integrity">
      <h3>Academic Integrity:</h3>
      <p>The University of Memphis has clear policies regarding academic and classroom misconduct. If you have any questions regarding standards for student conduct, please review the Fogelman College <a href="http://www.memphis.edu/fcbe/students/integrity.php" target="_blank" rel="noopener" aria-label="Website opens in new window">Standards for Academic Integrity</a> and the Office of Student Conduct <a href="http://www.memphis.edu/studentconduct/misconduct.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener" aria-label="Website opens in new window">Statement of Academic and Classroom Conduct</a>. My policy is that all students should honestly submit their own work, but just as collaboration is encouraged in the work place, it is allowed in this course.</p>
      </div>

      <h3>Late Assignments:</h3>
      <p>I will accept late submissions for some homework assignments with an appropriate grade penalty. I will not accept any late submissions after the last day of classes, and I will not accept any late submissions for quizzes or the practice set or any of its milestones. I will also not accept late homework submissions if I have already provided a solution to the homework assignment on the course portal.</p>

      <h3>Extra Credit:</h3>
      <p>I believe in rewarding exceptional effort with extra credit. Throughout the semester I may give opportunities for extra credit, such as correct puzzle solutions, as well as SETE reports. Additionally, for any assignment, I may, at my discretion, award extra points for exceptional submissions. I may also award extra credit to students who find and report errors, spelling or factual, in the course materials. You may contact me if you believe that your performance on a deliverable deserves extra credit. <em>However</em>, I will not accept any requests for extra credit once classes are over. Extra credit is not an opportunity to get a good grade at the last minute without having done any work during the semester, and I will not look upon that attitude favorably should I receive any such requests.</p>
