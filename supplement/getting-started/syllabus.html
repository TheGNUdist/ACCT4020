      <h2>Course Overview</h2>
      <p>This course explains how to become a <strong>professional</strong> <strong>accounting</strong> <strong>architect</strong>. Because you already know <strong>accounting</strong>, this course will focus on the other two components. The large <strong>architecture</strong> section of the course is an introduction to (1) the information life cycle, (2) information technology, and (3) IT controls from the perspective of an accountant, and the small <strong>professionalism</strong> section will address how to be a professional.</p>
      <p>This is not a course on accounting regulations. Financial accounting, audit, and tax fill those needs. This is not a course on calculating costs and revenues. That is for management accounting. This is also not a course on small business accounting software. All of those topics are relevant and valuable, but they are not the purpose of this course. This course will teach you about enterprise-grade information systems, information technology, and cyber-security. All accounting information comes from an information system, and as custodians of that information, it is the responsibility of accountants to understand and interact with these systems.</p>
      <p>As a result, this will feel like a technology course instead of an accounting course. That is not by accident. Understanding how firms maintain their accounting data is not about memorizing the debits and credits of journal entries. It is about (1) knowing the steps to convert raw data into information, (2) understanding the necessary technologies, and (3) knowing how to preserve data integrity and information security.</p>
      <p>This is not an easy course. The topics we will discuss will be new to most students, and the assignments will be difficult. Again, that is not by accident. In order to open your mind to the world of information systems, you will need to jump in and get your hands dirty. You should expect to spend between five and seven hours each week reading materials and completing assignments.</p>
      <p>You may ask why this course is structured this way. Many accounting courses rely on published textbooks and publisher-provided slide presentations and exams. It would be more convenient for me to follow this pattern, but I choose not to. Instead, I have spent countless hours creating my own lectures and assignments and curating reading materials. I have done this for two reasons. First, <em>your</em> future employers have demanded that you acquire skills in information technology and data analytics. Second, I want your skills in these areas to be better than anyone else's. You may not aspire to having IT skills, but this is the future of the accounting profession. Regardless of whether you like this course, I guarantee that this will not be one of those courses in which you will not learn anything. If you work, you <em>will</em> learn, and it will be worth it.</p>
      </div>

      <h3>Pre-requisites:</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>ACCT 3110 - Intermediate Accounting I</li>
        <li>ACCT 3310 - Cost Accounting</li>
      </ul>
      <p>A solid understanding of both financial and managerial accounting are valuable for this course. In order to understand the usefulness of an information system, it is vital to understand an organization's informational needs, and many of those needs come from financial and managerial accounting. Other information and control needs come from the tax and audit functions, and although not required, having already taken a course in taxation and a course in auditing would also be valuable preparation for this course.</p>

      <h3 style="page-break-before: always">Required Materials:</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><a href="https://accountingarchitecture.github.io" target="_blank" rel="noopener" aria-label="Website opens in new window">Course Portal</a></li>
        <li><a href="http://elearn.memphis.edu" target="_blank" rel="noopener" aria-label="Website opens in new windows">eCourseware</a></li>
        <li>Computer</li>
      </ul>
      <h4>Course Portal</h4>
      <p>The course portal provides access to all learning materials for this course. I have written the course portal to be accessible via desktop, laptop, and mobile device. The materials on the course portal are grouped by topic. Topics usually span one week; however, because we have more topics than weeks in the semester, some weeks have multiple topics. Each topic will contain some or all of the following items:</p>
      <dl>
        <dt>Lecture</dt>
          <dd>The lectures are required reading and the foundation for each new topic. This course has no textbook. The decision to avoid using a textbook is primarily to save you money&mdash;you're welcome&mdash;but also because the issues we address constantly change, and a textbook would quickly be out-of-date. Instead, I have written a series of lectures that provide the foundational content for each topic. The lectures are in slide format. I have gone to great lengths to make these slides thorough and readable. The slides are not in PowerPoint format, but rather are specially designed Web pages, readily viewable on any device. In order to navigate the slide deck, use the arrow keys on a keyboard, swipe horizontally on a touchscreen, or click or tap the arrow heads on the sides of each slide. You may also print the slides, if you wish. After opening a lecture, append <span class="code">?print-pdf</span> to the end of the lecture URL, and reload the page. This will allow you to print one slide per page. Depending on your printer settings, you may also be able to print multiple slides per page.</dd>
        <dt>Article</dt>
          <dd>Although I have tried to write thorough lectures, I have also tried to keep the lectures concise. As a result, the lectures will never give exhaustive treatment to any topic. In order to supplement the content in these lectures, I have identified additional articles that either extend the principles from the lecture or give examples of real-world implementation. All articles are also required readings.</dd>
        <dt>Homework</dt>
          <dd>Although thorough knowledge of the material in the lectures and articles is important, that knowledge is not enough. The value of technology is in the ability to use it, and the only way to learn to use it is to practice. Furthermore, the role of accountants is to collaborate with and provide information to other business functions. Collaboration requires both IT knowledge and communication skills. Each week you will have one or more homework assignments designed to provide experience with enterprise-grade IT tools or to reinforce your communication skills.</dd>
        <dt>Puzzle</dt>
          <dd>Puzzles are exercises that are designed to get the mental juices flowing. They are completely optional, but I will award a small amount of extra credit for each correct solution. Each puzzle has a separate Dropbox folder on eCourseware. You can submit your solution in any format you wish. However, if I cannot open the file, I will not grade it, so I would advise that you only upload PDF files.</dd>
      </dl>
      <p>The Home page of the course portal will display all current and future topics so that you may work ahead, if you choose. The Archive page stores all previous topics.</p>
      <h4>eCourseware</h4>
      <p>Although the course materials will be on the course portal, Dropbox folders, quizzes, exams, and grades will be on eCourseware. The course portal also displays a schedule of due dates throughout the semester. Where applicable, after submission deadlines, I will make puzzle and homework solutions available under the Content section of eCourseware.</p>
      <h4>Computer</h4>
      <p>All students must have access to a computer for this course. You may use a mobile device for readings and tutorials, but some assignments may require functionality that is not available on a mobile device. Desktops and laptops running any full operating system, as well as Chromebooks, are sufficient. Lab computers are available on campus for students who have no access to a computer.</p>

      <h3>Course Objectives:</h3>
      <p>The goal of this course is to teach:
      <ul>
        <li>The steps in the information life cycle.</li>
        <li>Common hardware, software, storage, and cloud computing components of an enterprise-grade information system.</li>
        <li>IT controls for data security, availability, integrity, and confidentiality.</li>
      </ul>
      <h3 style="page-break-before: always">Fogelman College: Learning Outcomes for Your Degree</h3>

      </div>

      <h3 style="page-break-before: always">Explanation and Schedule of Deliverables:</h3>
      <p>Please note, multiple deliverables have required file formats (e.g., PDF) for submission. The decision to submit a file that differs from the required format may result in a grade penalty. I will not grade any submission that fails to satisfy the assignment instructions.</p>
      <h4>Quizzes</h4>
      <p>In order to encourage careful reading throughout the semester, a quiz will accompany each topic. Quizzes will be multiple choice and true-false and will cover both lectures and articles. The course portal reports the due date and time for each quiz. All quizzes will be on eCourseware. <em>I will not reopen any quizzes, and I will not offer any makeup quizzes.</em></p>
      <h4>Homework</h4>
      <p>Practical experience is more valuable than simply listening to lectures. I will assign several homework assignments throughout the semester to give you the opportunity to practice what you have learned. Depending on the assignment, you will submit a document, screenshot, diagram, etc., as evidence of your work. These homework assignments will require several hours of work. The course portal reports all homework due dates, and the homework assignment instructions explain how to complete and submit the homework. Homework assignments fall into two categories:</p>
      <dl>
        <dt>Writing Assignments</dt>
        <dd>Writing assignments allow you to practice written communication. Collaboration will always be necessary to work as an accounting professional; communication will always be necessary for collaboration; and written communication will always be necessary for communication. The importance of written communication for accounting professionals means that you should use these assignments to improve your skills in written communication as I will grade writing assignments on completeness, grammar, spelling, and formatting. The <a href="http://www.memphis.edu/cwc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" aria-label="Website opens in new window">Center for Writing and Communication</a> (CWC) can provide you with one-on-one consultations to help you to improve your writing skills.</dd>
        <dt>Interactive Assignments</dt>
        <dd>The other part of collaboration is speaking the same language, and speaking the same language requires similar knowledge. Accountants collaborate with IT specialists to design and maintain information systems, collect and process data, and provide information that meets the needs of internal and external stakeholders. Similar knowledge necessary for collaboration begins with familiarity with the same technologies, and familiarity requires more than reading lectures and articles. Interactive assignments allow you to gain familiarity with information technologies by using them. I will grade interactive assignments on completeness. I encourage you to start each interactive assignment long before the due date in order to troubleshoot any issues you might have.</dd>
      </dl>
      <p><strong>You must earn at least a 65% average on homework in order to pass this course</strong>. I will not grade any homework assignment that fails to satisfy the assignment instructions. I will allow you to redo any homework assignment on which you earned less than 65% in order to raise your grade on that assignment. However, it will be your responsibility to identify and correct errors, resubmit the assignment, and then notify me via email if you want to have an assignment regraded. I will not place a limit on the number of times that you may resubmit an assignment to earn a higher grade. However, you may not resubmit any assignments after the last day of classes.</p>
      <div id="research">
      <h4>Research</h4>
      <p>Course materials and quizzes center around content that I have curated, but I also wish to encourage independent reading, thinking, and learning. Each student will complete two deliverables to demonstrate independent research:</p>
      <dl>
        <div id="ai-report">
        <dt>AI Report</dt>
        <dd>Each AI report will answer the following question, "How will AI affect the future of the accounting profession?" Reports should be at least 1,000 words in length and draw on materials beyond lecture slides and readings that I provide. This report should not be a discussion of your opinion; it should rely on externally valid references (a minimum of 5). I will not dictate which citation format, but I require that each report use a citation format for all references.

      <h2>Course Policies</h2>
      <div id="email">
      <h3>Email:</h3>
      <p>Email to my University of Memphis email address is how you may communicate with me. You should not, under any circumstances, use eCourseware's email function. I will communicate using email, as well, and I will always try to respond to email within 24 hours. However, I will not respond to emails on weekends. Instead, I will answer emails sent on Friday evening, Saturday, or Sunday on Monday.</p>
      <p>You must always follow these guidelines when drafting an email:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Use a proper salutation. Do not use &ldquo;Hello,&rdquo; &ldquo;Hey,&rdquo; &ldquo;Hi,&rdquo; &ldquo;Good morning,&rdquo; &ldquo;Good afternoon,&rdquo; &ldquo;Good evening,&rdquo; or other informal salutations. Addressing the recipient by name (if known) is preferred. Type the recipient's title (&ldquo;Dr.", &ldquo;Mr.", &ldquo;Mrs.", &ldquo;Ms.&rdquo; etc.) and the recipient's last name, followed by a comma, colon, or hyphen. You should never use the recipient's first name unless you have express permission to do so. If you are uncertain which title to use, it is safe to use the title in the recipient's signature block if the recipient has previously emailed you. For professors, use the titles '&ldquo;Dr.&rdquo; or &ldquo;Professor&rdquo; followed by the recipient's last name. If you do not know the name of the person you are writing to, use the salutation &ldquo;Dear Sir or Madam:&rdquo; or &ldquo;To whom it may concern:"</li>
        <li>Introduce yourself in the first paragraph. Explain who you are and why you are writing. When writing to a professor, also explain which class and section you are in. This introduction should be in the first sentence or two of your email. The following is a list of inappropriate reasons for writing an email to me:
          <ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha">
            <li>You should not email me about an assignment on the day that an assignment is due. I will not respond to these emails because it encourages procrastination.</li>
            <li>You should not email me asking that a deadline be changed, nor should you email me to ask whether you can make up an assignment. The syllabus explains which assignments you can make up and which assignments you cannot make up. I will not change this policy, even for unexpected events. All course deliverables are available well before their deadlines so no unexpected event should prevent you from completing them.</li>
            <li>You should not email me about your grade. Using your gradebook on eCourseware and the syllabus explanation of deliverables, you can determine your own standing in the course. You should not email me at the end of the semester asking for a higher grade or for special extra credit to raise your grade. I will not raise grades for any reason. You can earn a higher grade by working more diligently during the semester.</li>
          </ol>
        </li>
        <li>Use formal language. Use complete sentences and polite phrasing. Never write emails as you would write text messages. Avoid slang, contractions, emoticons and emojis, profanity, jokes, accusations, and rude or offensive language.</li>
        <li>Use a proper form of closing. Examples of potential closings include: &ldquo;Sincerely,&rdquo; &ldquo;Respectfully,&rdquo; or &ldquo;Your student,&rdquo; (if emailing a professor) followed by your full name and job title or other signature (if you have one).</li>
        <li>Proofread your message for content, spelling, and grammar. Do not rely on your email service's spelling or grammar checker. Reading your email aloud or asking someone to proofread it is a great way to catch any typos, mistakes, or unclear phrases.</li>
      </ol>
      <p>If you fail to follow these rules when emailing me, I will return your email with directions to rewrite it. For additional information regarding proper email etiquette, please review the <a href="https://www.memphis.edu/fcbe/students/netiquette.php" target="_blank" rel="noopener" aria-label="Website opens in new window">Fogelman College Netiquette Guide</a>.</p>
