      <h3>Extra Credit</h3>
      <p>Each semester I work diligently to improve this course, and you have all reaped the benefit of the efforts that I have already made to keep the materials free and up-to-date. I would appreciate constructive feedback from you that I can use in future semesters, and as a result, I give extra credit for an SETE. In order to receive the credit, please complete the SETE, print the confirmation page to PDF, and upload it to Dropbox on eCourseware. Also, if you liked this course, I would appreciate positive ratings on <a href="http://www.ratemyprofessors.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" aria-label="Website opens in new window">Rate My Professors</a>, as well. Thank you.</p>
