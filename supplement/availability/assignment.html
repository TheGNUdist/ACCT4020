      <h3>Interactive Assignment - Intro</h3>
      <p>GitHub is a popular cloud-based store of git repositories. In fact, the materials for this course are stored on GitHub. This assignment will teach you how to use both git and GitHub. Git is a VCS, and GitHub is an Web service that hosts git repositories. I have created a repository on GitHub, and you will use git to make contributions to this repository following the steps on the next screens.</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Create a free GitHub account. (<a href="https://github.com/join?source=header-home" target="_blank" rel="noopener" aria-label="Website opens in new window">link</a>)</li>
        <li>Log in to GitHub, navigate to the assignment repository (<a href="https://github.com/accountingarchitecture/acct4020-github-assignment" target="_blank" rel="noopener" aria-label="Website opens in new window">link</a>), and click the &lsquo;Fork&rsquo; button in the top right corner of the screen.</li>
        <li>Click the &lsquo;Clone or download&rsquo; button and copy the URL under the label &lsquo;Clone with HTTPS Use Git or checkout with SVN using the web URL.&rsquo;</li>
      </ol>

      <h3>Instructions - Page 1 of 3</h3>
      <ol start="4">
        <li>Use git in an SSH Terminal of your Linux container to clone your fork using the URL from the previous step.</li>
        <li>List the contents of your current folder to confirm that you have cloned the repository and created a folder named acct4020-github-assignment.</li>
        <li>Navigate to the Quotes folder within the acct4020-github-assignment folder.</li>
        <li>Using the UNIX philosophy, redirect your favorite quote to a file with your name. For example, my quote would be &ldquo;When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not price. --Richard Stallman&rdquo; and my filename would be ProfessorCoyne. (NB: Do not use any spaces in your filename.)</li>
        <li>List local repository changes to confirm that you have an untracked file with your name.</li>
      </ol>

      <h3>Instructions - Page 2 of 3</h3>
      <ol start="9">
        <li>Stage your changes.</li>
        <li>Assign yourself a username in git: <strong>git config user.name</strong>. (For example, I would type: git config user.name "Professor Coyne").
        <li>Assign yourself an email address in git: <strong>git config user.email</strong>. (For example, I would type: git config user.email "jgcoyne@memphis.edu").
        <li>Commit your changes to your local git repository with the commit message "Add [Your Name] quote" (without brackets). For example, my commit message would be "Add Professor Coyne quote".</li>
        <li>Push the changes in your local master branch to the GitHub repository named origin. Git will ask for your GitHub username and password. (When you type your password, your container will not provide any visual feedback of your typing, but it will record your key presses, so simply type your password and press ENTER.)</li>
      </ol>

      <h3>Instructions - Page 3 of 3</h3>
      <ol start="14">
        <li>After pushing your changes, return to your forked repository on GitHub.</li>
        <li>Click the gray &lsquo;New pull request&rsquo; button.</li>
        <li>On the next <em>two</em> screens, click the green &lsquo;Create pull request&rsquo; button. After clicking this button on the second screen, you may close the browser window.</li>
      </ol>
      <p>Once you have completed those steps, I will receive a notification from GitHub. This will serve as evidence that you have completed the assignment.</p>
