			<h3>Diagramming Assignment</h3>
			<p>The lecture slides contain a number of diagrams with narratives explaining the diagrammed process. The purpose of this assignment is to give you similar experience in reading and interpreting a flowchart. You will find the flowchart on the course portal. Your assignment is to write a narrative explaining the process that the flowchart depicts in your own words. Format your narrative as a memo with proper heading (i.e., To:, From:, Date:, and Subject:). I will grade your memo on its accuracy in explaining the diagrammed process, as well as proper spelling and grammar. Save your memo as a PDF, and upload it to Dropbox on eCourseware.</p>
