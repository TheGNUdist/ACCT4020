					<h1>Storage Solutions &amp; Cloud Computing</h1>
					<p class="summary">This lecture will address the two remaining blocks in the Technology section. I have combined them together for two reasons. First, a primary consideration of cloud computing is storage, so these two topics naturally belong together, and second, we have too little time remaining this semester to cover everything I would like to cover. <b>For all students</b>: The final slide contains a homework assignment that is due Saturday, November 21 @ 23.59. This is assignment is necessary in order to complete the assignment that I will give next week.</p>

					<h1>Software Development</h1>
					<p class="summary">This is the final topic for the Software block of the Architecture. This topic addresses tools and frameworks used by firms for in-house software development. The video is a guest lecture by a software engineer at a prominent financial institution. This lecture also introduced the Framework Contribution assignment. I have added several materials to the Readings to explain how to use Git and GitHub, and I have modified the syllabus to reflect the exact steps in completing this assignment.</p>

					<h1>Data Analytics</h1>
					<p class="summary">This topic is a continuation of the Software block in the Architecture. Unlike other topics, I will not provide a lecture or lecture slides for data analytics because we will not have an in-class lecture of this topic. Instead, I have a longer list of required readings, as well as videos that introduce specific analytical tools. I cannot provide you with access to multiple tools, but if, after reviewing the materials on Splunk, you wish to try it out, please email me, and I can share the credentials for my Splunk Light server with you. We will have presentations next week, and these are the available extra-credit topics:</p>
						<ol style="list-style-position: inside; font-weight: bold; padding-bottom: 30px">
							<li>Give a history of the Apache Foundation and explain how it has promoted and contributed to the open source movement, especially in the context of Big Data and data analytics.</li>
							<li>Introduce Cloudera and its business model and explain the role it has played in data analytics. Focus on its ability to leverage open source software for profit, and compare it to other companies who operate in this space.</li>
							<li>Provide a perspective on how current analytical tools could and should reshape the accounting and auditing professions. Offer and support your personal opinion.</li>
						</ol>
					<p class="summary">Although I only list three extra-credit topics, I wish to have four presentations. The fourth presenter may present on any topic relevant to the Accounting Architecture with a preference for issues pertaining to data analytics. Students from the live section should email me by end of business on Wednesday to volunteer to present, and online students should email me by end of business on Friday, as always.

					<h1>Operating Systems</h1>
					<p class="summary">The Software topic will span multiple weeks. This first set of slides focuses mostly on operating systems and includes extra-credit student presentations and a homework assignment. The tutorials explain how to install Ubuntu Linux on Virtualbox. I have created the first, and I found the second on YouTube. I am not responsible for the content of the second tutorial. You can easily find additional tutorials on YouTube. I will add required and optional readings later this week.</p>

					<h1>Storage Diagrams</h1>
					<p class="summary">This lecture discusses the concepts of storage, primarily in the context of digital databases, as well as conceptual database models. This will be a multi-week topic, but I cannot yet determine whether it will take two or three weeks. Because of Fall Break, we will not have student presentations next week, but regardless of the progress we will have made after today's lecture and next Wednesday's lecture, we will have student presentations the following week. If necessary, I will continue to lecture on this topic two weeks from now.</p>

					<h1>Open Content</h1>
					<p class="summary">This lecture introduces several forms on open content. I have uploaded the lecture slides, and I will add required and optional readings in the next few days. <b>For the online students</b>: Four presentations for this topic are due October 7 @ 23.59. The final slide lists extra credit presentations. Although I only list three extra credit topics, I will assign the final extra credit topic to two students to encourage multiple opinions on the issue. As a result, we will not have any self-selected topics for presentations this week. Again, you have until end of business on Friday to email me volunteering for a topic.</p>

					<h1>Information Life Cycle</h1>
					<p class="summary">This guest lecture series, given by my co-author Emily M. Coyne, addresses the information life cycle which is the top of the Accounting Architecture arch. The first of the two lectures addresses the Creation and Maintenance blocks, and the second lecture addresses the Use block. <b>For the online section</b>: Four presentations for this topic are due September 30 @ 23.59. The Lecture 2 slides identify two extra-credit presentation topics. You have until end of business on Friday to email me if you wish to volunteer to present on either of them or to be one of the other two presenters on a current topic pertaining to information and technology. After end of business on Friday, I will select students to fill the remaining slots. I will contact those students via email.</p>

					<h1>Business Process Diagramming</h1>
					<p class="summary">Although the focus of this course is on the information system, it is necessary to understand business activities in order to know the information needs of the firm. Diagramming is a popular tool to communicate business processes, and the ability to read and write diagrams is a useful skill. Later on this week I will add a recording of a lecture drawing sample business processes in draw.io.</p>

					<h1>Professionalism</h1>

Some of the readings for this topic are from the University of Memphis library and require a login to access. Remember, the readings are for the live and the online sections. Also, although the Lecture link is generally only for the online students, in this case, I would recommend that all students read the lecture because it contains content that we have not covered in class.</p>

					<p class="summary"><b>For the online section:</b> Please try to solve each puzzle, and upload your attempt to the Dropbox folder in eCourseware. I recommend that you work the problems by hand and submit a scanned image or a photograph from your phone to the Dropbox folder labeled Puzzles. Be aware that these problems with likely cover multiple pages, and you may need to submit multiple images. If you are brave, you can try to create a solution digitally using LaTeX or Word or any other software you choose. If you choose this second route, please export your solution to PDF before submitting to Dropbox. The submission is due Friday, and as with the other homework assignments in this course, it will count towards your Participation grade.</p>

					<h1>News: Final Exam</h1>

As with the Framework Contribution assignment, you can work alone or in groups of no more than three. Each group should upload one file to Dropbox and should clearly indicate the group members. All groups members should contribute to all questions, no group should allocate individual questions to individual group members.</p>

					<h1>SETE</h1>

I have created a Dropbox folder named SETE. Please take a screenshot of the receipt screen (the screen after submitting the SETE) as evidence of completion and upload it to this Dropbox folder. Naturally, I would particularly like positive ratings, but honesty is the best policy, so perhaps we can compromise, and you can honestly only say nice things about me!</p>

I would have preferred to spend more time on this topic, but the end of the semester is upon us. I will cover as much of this lecture as possible in the live section today. On Wednesday, I will discuss encryption, and then, as agreed, I will give a lecture on BitCoin. These slides are not yet complete, but I will complete them by Wednesday, and I will add the BitCoin slides by Wednesday, as well.</p>

					<h1>News: SQL Assignment</h1>
					<p class="summary">Some students have had difficulties using MySQL or MariaDB through their Linux virtual machines. I have tried to replicate these issues, so that I could explain workarounds. First, if you install MySQL or MariaDB and never receive a password prompt during the installation, you can log in to your database without a password (i.e., mysql -uroot). The reason for this occurrence is that these password prompts require a minimum screen size that is larger than your virtual machine window. Second, if you attempt to log in to your database and receive the error: &ldquo;Access denied for user 'root'@'localhost'&rdquo; then you should prepend sudo to your mysql command (i.e., sudo mysql -uroot). If your error is: &ldquo;Can't connect to local MySQL server through socket '/var/mysql/mysql.sock'&rdquo; then you have not properly installed mariadb-server or mysql-server. If you believe that you have installed the server correctly, trying restarting your virtual machine.</p>

You may use any application that you choose (e.g., Microsoft Word) to draft your submission, but I offer extra credit for using LaTeX or HTML and CSS. (This only counts for code written by hand, no code-building tools.) Upload your submission to Dropbox. The final exam is due on Wednesday, December 9 @ 12.00.</p>

					<p class="summary">This is a tutorial explaining how to install MySQL, import a database and run queries. I will link to tutorial as soon as it is available. I have included two databases. I will use the first in the tutorial, and the second is for the SQL assignment. Although I include the list of questions here, you will complete this assignment on eCourseware. There you will find an SQL quiz. For each question, you will write the query necessary to find the answer, as well as the answer to the question itself. I will grade based on accuracy of the query and accuracy of the answer. This quiz is due Monday, November 30 @ 23.59.</p>
