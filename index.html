					<h1>News: Final Exam</h1>
					<p class="summary">As I have indicated via email, I have decided to allow you to work in groups for the final exam. As with the Framework Contribution assignment, you can work alone or in groups of no more than three. Each group should upload one file to Dropbox and should clearly indicate the group members. All groups members should contribute to all questions, no group should allocate individual questions to individual group members.</p>

					<h1>SETE</h1>
					<p class="summary">After some consideration, I have decided to award anyone who completes a student rating (SETE) an additional five participation points. I have created a Dropbox folder named SETE. Please take a screenshot of the receipt screen (the screen after submitting the SETE) as evidence of completion and upload it to this Dropbox folder. Naturally, I would particularly like positive ratings, but honesty is the best policy, so perhaps we can compromise, and you can honestly only say nice things about me!</p>

					<h1>Controls</h1>
					<p class="summary">This is a condensed lecture of the Control section of the Accounting Architecture. I would have preferred to spend more time on this topic, but the end of the semester is upon us. I will cover as much of this lecture as possible in the live section today. On Wednesday, I will discuss encryption, and then, as agreed, I will give a lecture on BitCoin. These slides are not yet complete, but I will complete them by Wednesday, and I will add the BitCoin slides by Wednesday, as well.</p>

					<h1>News: SQL Assignment</h1>
					<p class="summary">Some students have had difficulties using MySQL or MariaDB through their Linux virtual machines. I have tried to replicate these issues, so that I could explain workarounds. First, if you install MySQL or MariaDB and never receive a password prompt during the installation, you can log in to your database without a password (i.e., mysql -uroot). The reason for this occurrence is that these password prompts require a minimum screen size that is larger than your virtual machine window. Second, if you attempt to log in to your database and receive the error: &ldquo;Access denied for user 'root'@'localhost'&rdquo; then you should prepend sudo to your mysql command (i.e., sudo mysql -uroot). If your error is: &ldquo;Can't connect to local MySQL server through socket '/var/mysql/mysql.sock'&rdquo; then you have not properly installed mariadb-server or mysql-server. If you believe that you have installed the server correctly, trying restarting your virtual machine.</p>

					<h1>Final Exam</h1>
					<p class="summary">As discussed in the live section, I have decided to make the final exam questions available now. You may use any application that you choose (e.g., Microsoft Word) to draft your submission, but I offer extra credit for using LaTeX or HTML and CSS. (This only counts for code written by hand, no code-building tools.) Upload your submission to Dropbox. The final exam is due on Wednesday, December 9 @ 12.00.</p>

					<h1>SQL</h1>
					<p class="summary">This is a tutorial explaining how to install MySQL, import a database and run queries. I will link to tutorial as soon as it is available. I have included two databases. I will use the first in the tutorial, and the second is for the SQL assignment. Although I include the list of questions here, you will complete this assignment on eCourseware. There you will find an SQL quiz. For each question, you will write the query necessary to find the answer, as well as the answer to the question itself. I will grade based on accuracy of the query and accuracy of the answer. This quiz is due Monday, November 30 @ 23.59.</p>
