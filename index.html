					<h1>News: Assignments and Solutions</h1>
					<p class="summary">Following student feedback, I had added a solution for the journal entry metadata assignment to the Archive. I have also updated the lecture slides for the Business Process Diagramming lecture to include a narrative explaining each of the sample diagrams throughout the lecture. This should help to prepare you for the homework assignment due on Tuesday. Also, I have decided to modify the second homework assignment slightly. I will create a diagram in class on Tuesday, but instead of asking you to duplicate the flowchart that I will create in class, I will ask you to duplicate the flowchart that I have already posted. The first homework assignment will remain as explained in the lecture slides. I have also moved the explanation of this modified second homework assignment to the lecture slides.</p>

This lecture will introduce multiple diagramming models and explain how to read and write diagrams. This topic has no readings, and we will not have student presentations next week. Instead of student presentations, on Tuesday, February 16, I will demonstrate a popular free online diagramming tool. After the lecture, I will add a link to a video of the demonstration.</p>

					<h1>Storage Solutions &amp; Cloud Computing</h1>
					<p class="summary">This lecture will address the two remaining blocks in the Technology section. I have combined them together for two reasons. First, a primary consideration of cloud computing is storage, so these two topics naturally belong together, and second, we have too little time remaining this semester to cover everything I would like to cover. <b>For all students</b>: The final slide contains a homework assignment that is due Saturday, November 21 @ 23.59. This is assignment is necessary in order to complete the assignment that I will give next week.</p>

					<h1>Data Analytics</h1>
					<p class="summary">This topic is a continuation of the Software block in the Architecture. Unlike other topics, I will not provide a lecture or lecture slides for data analytics because we will not have an in-class lecture of this topic. Instead, I have a longer list of required readings, as well as videos that introduce specific analytical tools. I cannot provide you with access to multiple tools, but if, after reviewing the materials on Splunk, you wish to try it out, please email me, and I can share the credentials for my Splunk Light server with you. We will have presentations next week, and these are the available extra-credit topics:</p>
						<ol style="list-style-position: inside; font-weight: bold; padding-bottom: 30px">
							<li>Give a history of the Apache Foundation and explain how it has promoted and contributed to the open source movement, especially in the context of Big Data and data analytics.</li>
							<li>Introduce Cloudera and its business model and explain the role it has played in data analytics. Focus on its ability to leverage open source software for profit, and compare it to other companies who operate in this space.</li>
							<li>Provide a perspective on how current analytical tools could and should reshape the accounting and auditing professions. Offer and support your personal opinion.</li>
						</ol>
					<p class="summary">Although I only list three extra-credit topics, I wish to have four presentations. The fourth presenter may present on any topic relevant to the Accounting Architecture with a preference for issues pertaining to data analytics. Students from the live section should email me by end of business on Wednesday to volunteer to present, and online students should email me by end of business on Friday, as always.

This will be a multi-week topic, but I cannot yet determine whether it will take two or three weeks. Because of Fall Break, we will not have student presentations next week, but regardless of the progress we will have made after today's lecture and next Wednesday's lecture, we will have student presentations the following week. If necessary, I will continue to lecture on this topic two weeks from now.</p>

As with the Framework Contribution assignment, you can work alone or in groups of no more than three. Each group should upload one file to Dropbox and should clearly indicate the group members.

I have created a Dropbox folder named SETE. Please take a screenshot of the receipt screen (the screen after submitting the SETE) as evidence of completion and upload it to this Dropbox folder. Naturally, I would particularly like positive ratings, but honesty is the best policy, so perhaps we can compromise, and you can honestly only say nice things about me!</p>

					<h1>News: SQL Assignment</h1>
					<p class="summary">Some students have had difficulties using MySQL or MariaDB through their Linux virtual machines. I have tried to replicate these issues, so that I could explain workarounds. First, if you install MySQL or MariaDB and never receive a password prompt during the installation, you can log in to your database without a password (i.e., mysql -uroot). The reason for this occurrence is that these password prompts require a minimum screen size that is larger than your virtual machine window. Second, if you attempt to log in to your database and receive the error: &ldquo;Access denied for user 'root'@'localhost'&rdquo; then you should prepend sudo to your mysql command (i.e., sudo mysql -uroot). If your error is: &ldquo;Can't connect to local MySQL server through socket '/var/mysql/mysql.sock'&rdquo; then you have not properly installed mariadb-server or mysql-server. If you believe that you have installed the server correctly, trying restarting your virtual machine.</p>

I will use the first in the tutorial, and the second is for the SQL assignment. Although I include the list of questions here, you will complete this assignment on eCourseware. There you will find an SQL quiz. For each question, you will write the query necessary to find the answer, as well as the answer to the question itself. I will grade based on accuracy of the query and accuracy of the answer. This quiz is due Monday, November 30 @ 23.59.</p>
