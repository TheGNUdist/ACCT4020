			<h2>Becoming a Professional</h2>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h3>Before Knowledge</h3>
			<p>Before we begin our discussions of information, technology, and control, I wish to impress upon your minds the attitudes necessary to successfully transition from student to professional. In this course, I can impart knowledge (if, and only if, you are willing to receive it), but the metamorphosis from student to professional involves more than the acquisition of core competencies. Professionalism is a commitment to a way of life.</p>

			<h3>Reasons for Fraud</h3>

				<div class="flex-item" style="max-width: 60%">
					<p>The Fraud Triangle highlights the three necessary conditions for fraud to occur: pressure (e.g., financial or peer), opportunity, and rationalization (i.e., the belief that the fraud was justified). Later in the course, we will discuss controls as a means to reduce opportunity, but only internal commitment can prevent rationalization. Professionalism is the embodiment of that commitment.</p>

			<h3>Why Professionalism Matters to You</h3>
			<blockquote>In an era where competition is accelerating, jobs are scarce, and the world is meaner, professionalism and work ethic can differentiate strong from average performers. Whether or not we like it, professional behaviour matters.<br>&ndash; Dr. Colleen Sharen</blockquote>
			<p style="text-align: center">Soon, your focus will be on interviews, internships, and jobs. Professionalism sets you apart.</p>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h3>Why <em>Else</em> Professionalism Matters to You</h3>
			<blockquote>The boundary is powerful because you don't cross it; if you have justified doing it once, there's nothing to stop you doing it again.<br>&ndash; Dr. Clayton Christensen</blockquote>
			<p style="text-align: center">Professionalism keeps you out of jail.</p>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h3>Professionalism Defined</h3>
			<blockquote>The skill, judgment, and polite behavior that is expected from a person who is trained to do a job well; the conduct, aims, or qualities that mark a profession or a professional person.<br>&ndash; Merriam-Webster</blockquote>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h3>Professional Traits</h3>
				<p>The <a href="http://www.aicpa.org/research/standards/codeofconduct/Pages/default.aspx">AICPA Code of Professional Conduct</a> lists the following Principles of Professional Conduct:
			<ul>
				<li>Responsibilities</li>
				<li>The Public Interest</li>
				<li>Integrity</li>
				<li>Objectivity and Independence</li>
				<li>Due Care</li>
				<li>Scope and Nature of Services</li>
			</ul>
			<p>These principles highlight five professional characteristics: diligence, competence, responsibility, integrity and objectivity.</p>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h3>Diligence</h3>
			<p style="text-align: center"><i>Patton</i></p>
			<div class="flex-row top">
				<div class="flex-item" style="max-width: 50%">
					<iframe src="https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B1wE9_dgrqtYWml1Y3NMMWtWbkU/preview" width="420" height="315" allowfullscreen></iframe>

				</div>
			</div>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h3>Diligence vs. Prioritization</h3>
			<p>Laziness will achieve nothing, but diligence is most fruitful when focused on the <em>best</em> activities. We only ever accomplish a goal when we invest in that goal. Diligently pursuing a distraction is not a substitute.</p>
			<p>Furthermore, only the pursuit of valuable goals is valuable. Even the most dedicated pursuit of a useless goal (e.g., mastering <i>Guitar Hero</i> on the most difficult setting) is useless.</p>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h3>Competence</h3>
			<p>Although you should always work to develop each of these traits, this one is the most relevant for you right now. Competence is knowledge, and each professional must possess a common body of knowledge. The <em>active</em> acquisition of this body of knowledge requires diligence, reasoning and accreditation. Fogelman provides the latter, but you are responsible for the former. My role is to support you, but I cannot teach you, unless you choose to learn.</p>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h3>Responsibility</h3>

				</div>
			</div>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h3>Choices Have Consequences</h3>
			<p>One of the most important lessons from any public fraud or scandal is that choices have consequences. Take responsibility for yourselves, as well as others.</p>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h3>Integrity and Objectivity</h3>
			<ul>
				<li>Tell the truth.</li>
				<li>Never withhold relevant information in order to mislead others.</li>
				<li>Consider all the facts, even when they disagree with your opinions.</li>
				<li>Keep commitments.</li>
				<li>Stand for something.</li>
			</ul>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h3>Two Sides of the Triangle</h3>
			<div class="flex-row">
				<div class="flex-item" style="max-width: 60%">
					<p>Nick Leeson would never have been able to accumulate sufficient losses to bring down an entire bank if he had told the truth after the first bad trade. Interestingly, professionalism would have reduced both pressure and rationalization.</p>

		<section>
			<h3>Respect</h3>
			<p>This is not a focus of the AICPA Code of Professional Conduct, but polite behavior is a part of the definition of professionalism, and respect is clearly a relevant component of polite behavior.</p>

		<section>
			<h3>Four Aspects of Proper Comportment</h3>
			<ol>
				<li><u><i>Proper speech</i></u>: Use correct grammar; avoid slang, profanity and filler words; refrain from interrupting.</li>
				<li><u><i>Correct address</i></u>: Avoid first names without permission; use the highest title.</li>
				<li><u><i>Professional dress</i></u>: Suit, long-sleeved, button-down shirt and tie for males; pants or skirt suit, button-down blouse and closed-toe shoes for females. These are the uniform of the professional.</li>
				<li><u><i>Humility</i></u>: Refrain from judging others; never use peer performance to excuse behavior.</li>
			</ol>
		</section>
		
		<section>
			<h3>Not the Bear</h3>
			<p>One rationale for using peer performance as an excuse is the belief that success in life involves not being eaten by a bear.</p>
			<blockquote>When being chased by a bear, it is not necessary to outrun the bear, just the person next to you.</blockquote>
		</section>
		
		<section>
			<h3>The Lion and the Gazelle</h3>
			<p>The life of a professional is not about being second-worst, but life will involve running.</p>
			<blockquote>Every morning in Africa, a gazelle wakes up, it knows it must outrun the fastest lion or it will be killed. Every morning in Africa, a lion wakes up. It knows it must run faster than the slowest gazelle, or it will starve. It doesn't matter whether you're the lion or a gazelle when the sun comes up, you'd better be running.</blockquote>
