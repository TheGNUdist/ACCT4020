			<h2>Access Controls</h2>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h3>Accounting Architecture</h3>
			<div class="flex-row">
				<div class="flex-item override"><img src="../../images/Arch5Color.png" alt="AA Arch" style="max-width: 300px"/></div>
				<div class="flex-item" style="max-width: 65%">
					<p>Information is the keystone of any information system, and Technology is the set of tools necessary to implement that system. Control, however, is a choice. A system can function without proper controls. However, a system without proper controls exposes internal and external stakeholders to risks. The different blocks in the Control section represent different control objectives.</p>
				</div>
			</div>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h3>External Stakeholders</h3>
			<p>Accountants care about external stakeholders. Financial accounting regulations exist to protect external stakeholders from misinformation. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles dictate the creation of financial statements to maximize comparability between firms. The Sarbanes-Oxley Act requires firms to implement internal controls over financial reporting to prevent misstatements in the financial statements. [more about SOX]</p>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h3>Risk Aversion</h3>
			<p>The foundation of the architecture implies the need for controls to satisfy regulatory compliance. However, that is not enough to satisfy external stakeholders. Although these are not always protected by regulation, external stakeholders are generally unwilling to tolerate breaches of privacy, loss of data relevant to them, and system unavailability. (Just think of how you would feel if your email, or heaven forbid your SMS service, stopped working.) Frequently, external parties draft contracts to protect themselves from these risks, so again the Compliance block becomes relevant for satisfying the demands of these external stakeholders.</p>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h3>Internal Stakeholders</h3>
			<p>Regulations and contracts generally would not cover internal stakeholders, but just as external stakeholders, they wish to avoid misinformation, which would result in misled strategic decisions, and to protect their privacy (although <i>confidentiality</i> would be a more appropriate term in this context). Because internal stakeholders are the biggest &ldquo;customer&rdquo; of the information system, protect them from risks becomes are primary goal of information system controls.</p>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h3><i>Cost</i>-Benefit Analysis</h3>
			<p>Three different types of controls exist: preventive, detective, and corrective. Any implementation of controls is costly, although 100% prevention would clearly be the best, the cost is prohibitive. As a result, the only cost effective solution involves a combination of all three types: preventing what can be prevented and detecting and correcting what cannot be prevented.</p>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h3>Cost-<i>Benefit</i> Analysis</h3>
			<p>The benefit of a control implementation is the reduction in either the <u><i>likelihood</i></u> of or <u><i>exposure</i></u> to unauthorized access, data loss, or data corruption. Likelihood is the probability of a problem, and exposure is the dollar loss from litigation, fines, lost business, cost of restoring a system and its data, etc., should a problem occur. The size of the loss can make a problem with a small likelihood a big problem, especially when regulatory compliance is very strict. Preventive controls can lower the likelihood of a problem, and detective and corrective controls can reduce the exposure (i.e., make a problem less bad or fix a problem more quickly). </p>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h3>Control Framework</h3>
			<p>Many control system frameworks exist that address the various types of risk that external and internal stakeholders face. Three well-known examples are (1) Internal Control&ndash;Integrated Framework and (2) Enterprise Risk Management&ndash;Integrated Framework by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) and (3) Control Objectives for Information and Related Technology (COBIT) by the Information Systems and Audit Control Association (ISACA). These are dense and comprehensive, though not necessarily comprehensible, so I have opted for the simpler AICPA Trust Services Framework.</p>
		</section>
		
		<section>
			<h3>Trust Services Framework</h3>
			<div class="flex-row">
				<div class="flex-item override"><img src="../../images/trust-services.png" alt="Trust Services Framework" style="max-width: 300px"/></div>
				<div class="flex-item" style="max-width: 70%">
					<p>The objectives of the Control leg of the Architecture mirror those of the AICPA Trust Services Framework:</p>
					<ul>
						<li><u><i>Security</i></u> protects against unauthorized access.</li>
						<li><u><i>Availability</i></u> prevents data loss and system downtime.</li>
						<li><u><i>Processing integrity</i></u> preserves data integrity.</li>
						<li><u><i>Confidentiality</i></u> and <u><i>privacy</i></u> maintain secrets. Because of their similarity, these two occupy the same block in the Architecture.</li>
					</ul>
				</div>
			</div>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h3>Security</h3>
			<blockquote>The system is protected against unauthorized access, use, or modification.<br>&ndash; AICPA Trust Services Framework</blockquote>
			<p>Access controls are the primary security tool. They promote system security in one of three ways:</p>
			<ol>
				<li><u><i>Permissions</i></u> determine what users are authorized to do.</li>
				<li><u><i>Authentication</i></u> allows authorized users to identify themselves.</li>
				<li><u><i>Hardening</i></u> and <u><i>isolation</i></u> prevent unauthorized access.</li>
			</ol>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h3>Why Permissions?</h3>
			<div class="flex-row">
				<!--License: CC-BY-SA 4.0 Attribution: DavidBailey-->
				<div class="flex-item override"><img src="../../images/fraudtriangle.png" alt="Fraud Triangle" style="max-height: 400px"/></div>
				<div class="flex-item" style="max-width: 60%">
					<p>The purpose of permissions is two-fold. First, permissions prevent outsiders (e.g., non-employees) from gaining access to confidential materials. Second, correctly assigned permissions prevent insiders from gaining access to content that would increase the <em>opportunity</em> to commit fraud by segregating incompatible duties.</p>
				</div>
			</div>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h3>Segregation of Duties</h3>
			<p>Segregation of duties discourages the assignment of multiple incompatible duties to the same individual. General guidelines for identifying incompatible duties include:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>Authorization for a transaction should be separate from the processing of a transaction. For example, a sales person should not be able to authorize sale of inventory on credit and process the sales transaction. This prevents that creation of fraudulent transactions.</li>
				<li>Custody of assets should be separate from record-keeping. For example, the raw materials store should not be responsible for maintaining records of the levels of raw materials. This prevents asset theft.</li>
			</ol>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h3>Supervision</h3>
			<p>Segregation of duties is an excellent tool for discouraging fraud by requiring individuals to collude in order to succeed in performing and concealing the act. However, sometimes this tool is not available either because the number of available employees is too small and employees need to assume incompatible duties or because a single duty is risky (e.g., unloading inventory from a truck before it is counted or opening envelopes of cash in the mail room). In these situations, supervision is a second-best alternative.</p>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h3>Physical Access</h3>
			<p>Permissions can apply to physical and digital resources. Using a file server as an example, digital permissions determine which users have access to which files, and physical permissions dictate who may enter the server room where that file server is stored. No amount of digital permissions replaces the need for physical permissions. If an attacker can gain access to the physical file server, then that user can gain access to any of the files on that server. <em>Physical access is total access</em>.</p>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h3>Digital Access</h3>
			<p>In our current cloud computing environment, most access is from remote locations (i.e., users on thin clients or workstations access a centralized web/database/file/email server or a shared printer). In these situations, permissions determine which users can use which physical devices (e.g., servers, printers) and which data objects (e.g., files, folders, database records, emails).</p>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h3>Database Permissions</h3>
			<p>Database permissions identify which users can (1) access the database and (2) initiate the four primary storage functions: <u><i>create</i></u>, <u><i>read</i></u>, <u><i>update</i></u>, and <u><i>delete</i></u> (CRUD). Create allows users to add new database records, read allows users to view existing records, update allows users to modify existing records, and delete allows users to remove records. Using SQL syntax as an example, the four basic commands are CREATE (or INSERT INTO), SELECT, UPDATE and DELETE. Each maps directly into one of the four storage functions.</p>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h3>File Permissions</h3>
			<p>Permissions in common file systems are less granular. Instead of identifying permissions for four storage functions, file systems focus on three functions: read, write, and execute. The overlap between file read and database read is apparent, but the other two file system functions are less similar to database functions. Create, update, and delete are all write functions because write permissions award the ability to edit. Execute governs launching applications. This permission has no useful meaning in a database setting. These three levels ostensibly match with the three protections in the AICPA definition of security: <i>access</i> (read), <i>use</i> (execute), <i>modification</i> (write).</p>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h3>Folder Permissions</h3>
			<p>File systems comprise both files and folders, and although the same three permissions (read, write, and execute) govern both files and folders, the interpretation differs between files and folders. Read allows the user to see the contents of a folder. Write allows a user to modify the contents of a folder. Execute allows the user to open a folder and interact with its contents. The distinction between read and execute is, perhaps, a bit technical and difficult to perceive; for Windows and OS X users (and any users of graphical file browsers), execute is the relevant permission for viewing folder contents.</p>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h3>Me Against the World</h3>
			<p>In addition to three functions (read, write, and execute), file permissions apply separately to three different types of users: owner, group, and world (or others). Owner and world are easy to understand: owner is the (usually) the creator of a file or folder; world is everyone who has no ownership. Group is a collection of users that need similar access but frequently less access than the owner. The owner may or may not belong to the group.</p>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h3>Symbolic Notation</h3>
			<p>Unix-like (i.e., POSIX) operating systems display file permissions in two different but equivalent ways. One is more readable and one is more concise. Symbolic notation, the more readable format, uses ten characters to explain whether the owner, group, or world can read (r), write (w), or execute (e). Missing permissions are replaced with hyphens.</p>

				</div>
			</div>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h3>First Character</h3>
			<p>Symbolic notation uses nine characters (i.e., three triads), but the string contains ten spaces. The first identifies the file type: regular file (-), directory (d), or link (l). Several other file types exist, but these three are the most common, and they suffice to understand symbolic notation.</p>
			<img src="../../images/symbolic-notation.png" alt="Permissions in Symbolic Notation"/>
			<p>This screenshot of the output of the &lsquo;ls -l&rsquo; command&mdash;these are lowercase L's&mdash;also displays ownership. In this case, ubuntu is the name of the owner, and the name of the group is also ubuntu.</p>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h3>Octal Permissions</h3>
			<p>Numeric notation, frequently referred to as octal or octet permissions, uses base-8 notation to report permissions. In this notation, &lsquo;read&rsquo; receives a value of 4, &lsquo;write&rsquo; a value of 2, and &lsquo;execute&rsquo; a value of 1. These are added together to obtain one value for each of three significant digit. The first digit reports owner permissions, the second reports group permissions, and the third reports world permissions.</p>

			<p>The three commonly reported digits are actually the second, third, and fourth digits of octal permissions. The first digit, which is frequently ignored, reports special settings which override the functionality of the default permissions. If no special override applies, this value is set to 0.</p>

			<h3>One User to Rule Them All</h3>
			<p>In any system, whether file or database, every data object must have an owner. In Windows it may seem that any user has read, write, and execute privileges to any file and folder; in Unix-like operating systems, including OS X because of its BSD foundation, most users only own content that they create in order to restrict write and, sometimes even read, access to system files. These files belong to <i>root</i>, also called the superuser or system user. In addition to owning the system files, the root user has full access (i.e., 777) to all files owned by any other user. Popular database systems also employ a root user who has all privileges and can grant those privileges to other users.</p>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h3><a href="http://xkcd.com/149/">Sudo Make Me a Sandwich</a></h3>
			<p>Because the root user owns system files, a normal user must obtain elevated permissions to alter the system (i.e., edit and delete system files or install applications). In Unix-like systems, this is done by either changing to the root user using the &lsquo;su&rsquo; command or, more likely, by prepending &lsquo;sudo&rsquo; to any command that requires elevated privileges. This second method is sometimes called fakeroot. (For an amusing commentary on sudo, click the title of this slide.)</p>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h3>Just Say No</h3>
			<p>Because it is easier to avoid issues with permissions, some succumb to the temptation to use the root user for everything. This is especially tempting when a user must launch an application that, in turn, launches another application. Because the two applications may be subject to different access controls, non-privileged users may have difficulty navigating a multi-application process. However, the decision to log in as and use the root user for everything is a <em>worst-case scenario</em> for security and should never be done; it increases the likelihood of unauthorized or unintended changes to the system. Consistent use of the root user is a red flag that proper IT controls are either not in place or have been ignored.</p>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h3>*nix Groups</h3>
			<p>POSIX groups are faceted, not hierarchical, so in Unix-like operating systems, users can belong to multiple groups. These groups frequently have no useful interpretation outside of the system because they are designed to assign control of software and hardware. For example, the &lsquo;storage&rsquo; group allows its members to access storage volumes, such as the internal hard drive or external USB drives; the &lsquo;lp&rsquo; group allows its members to use printers and scanners; the &lsquo;admin&rsquo; group&mdash;sometimes called the &lsquo;sudo&rsquo; or &lsquo;wheel&rsquo; group&mdash;allows its members to use the sudo command to receive elevated privileges.</p>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h3>Business Groups</h3>
			<p>In addition to the default groups in a Unix-like system, administrators can create additional groups at will to serve business purposes. The idea of groups in a Unix-like system is to award multiple users similar privileges to data objects, and this concept of groups matches the definition of groups in the traditional business sense (i.e., teams or departments). Using groups in this setting allows for owners to have primary access to data objects and for members of the same group as the owner to have lesser access (e.g., the owner has read-write access, and the other group members have read-only access.)</p>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h3>Roles</h3>
			<p>The emphasis of owner permissions over group permissions is incompatible with an important tenet of access controls: permissions should be role- and not user-based. The premise is that users only need access consistent with their job descriptions; all users in the same job role should have the same access; once a user changes roles, the user's access to data should change; and collections of roles (i.e., business groups) should have some, but likely lesser, access to the data of each role in the group.</p>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h3>Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)</h3>
			<p>By default Unix-like systems cannot set role-based permissions, and it is not possible to create a group for a role and another group for a department and assign both groups to a data object because Unix-like systems only allow one group per data object. Fortunately, tools exist that allow for assigning users in a Unix-like system to roles. Two popular examples are <i><u>Security-Enhanced Linux</u></i> (SELinux) and <i><u>Lightweight Directory Access Protocol</u></i> (LDAP). SELinux controls permissions a single Linux system, whereas LDAP controls permissions for an entire LAN across multiple different operating systems.</p>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h3>Examples of Role-based Permissions</h3>
			<p>Because many role-based permissions apply to database access, database permissions are useful for providing examples of RBAC.</p>

			<h3>Authentication</h3>
			<p>Permissions determine what an authorized user may do; authentication allows authorized users to identify themselves. Authentication has three forms:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><u><i>Something the user knows</i></u>: a password or passphrase.</li>
				<li><u><i>Something the user has</i></u>: a badge, key card, or code generator.</li>
				<li><u><i>Something about the user</i></u>: biometrics, such as face, voice, or thumb print.</li>
			</ul>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h3>Secure Passwords</h3>
			<p>The protection that passwords provide is only effective if an unauthorized user cannot guess the password. Brute-force attacks involve a computer randomly guessing what a password might be and attempting to log in with that password. Simple passwords, such as words commonly found in the dictionary or simple strings of numbers, are easy targets. Requiring long (e.g. &gt;12 characters), frequently changed (e.g., every 90 days), complex (e.g., upper- and lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters) passwords reduces the success of brute-force attacks. Of course, none of this matters if the user adopts the bad habit of writing down passwords and storing them in an accessible location (e.g., next to that user's workstation).</p>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h3>Disagree to Disagree</h3>
			<p>Different groups have differing beliefs on the best type of secure password. Some like the <u><i>passphrase</i></u> which essentially converts a, potentially nonsensical, sentence into a password (e.g., iamamericaandyoucantoo). Even within this </p>
		</section>

			<h3>Social Engineering</h3>
			<p></p>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h3>Time-based Codes</h3>
			<p></p>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h3>Multifactor Authentication</h3>
			<p>Security and convenience are always trade-offs. Anything that is more difficult for unauthorized users to access is also more difficult for authorized users to access. However, in many situations, the cost of added inconvenience is well worth avoiding exposure. In the current climate, one form of authentication is rarely enough to avoid problems. Passwords can be comprised through guessing, brute force or social engineering; key cards go missing; face or voice recognition can be faked. A combination of these is better (e.g., a password and a time-based code or a key card and a hand print).</p>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h3>Remote Authentication</h3>
			<p>Just as an LDAP server can store permissions, it can also store credentials. This is handy for allowing users to identify themselves on multiple machines on the same network, but in order for it to work, the user must already be in the network (LAN). Remote Authentication Dial-in User Service (RADIUS) allows users outside of the network (WAN) to authenticate themselves to access LAN resources. RADIUS is often used in virtual private network (VPN) and wireless local area network (WLAN) (i.e., WiFi) access.</p>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h3>Hardening</h3>
			<p>Hardening reduces a system's surface of vulnerability. Firewalls and network traffic monitors are popular hardening tools because these restrict access to network devices. Additionally, hardening involves removing old authentication credentials and disabling unnecessary services (i.e., daemons) and closing their respective ports.</p>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h3>Firewalls</h3>
			<p>Because it is possible to use authentication protocols to access a LAN from the WAN, it can also be possible to gain unauthorized access from the WAN. Firewalls, or more generally packet filters, restrict network traffic to and from certain network ports on certain devices. Firewalls are like Dementors in that they cannot distinguish between authorized and unauthorized traffic.</p>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h3>What Day is It?</h3>
			<p>In the context of software development, hardening involves apply patches to exploits. Although it is best to write the software correctly the first time, exploits arise because developers cut corners or make mistakes. They also arise because people invent new ways to exploit software. A zero-day exploit is a software exploit that is found before the developers know about, and this is an increasingly frequent occurrence.</p>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h3>What Can Exploits Do?</h3>
			<p>One problem with software exploits is that frequently result in the user gaining elevated privileges or accessing unauthorized content. This is how iOS devices are jailbroken or Android devices rooted.</p>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h3>Availability</h3>
			<blockquote>The system is available for operation and use as committed or agreed.</blockquote>
			<p>Two threats of availability are data loss and downtime. Three tools combat these threats:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><u><i>Interpretation</i></u> preserves accessibility of legacy data.</li>
				<li><u><i>Redundancy</i></u> avoids data loss and unplanned downtime.</li>
				<li><u><i>Change management</i></u> limits planned downtime.</li>
			</ul>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h3>Interpretation</h3>
			<p>I cannot say what the original reason was for the Unix philosophy that the basis of all data is plan text, but a significant benefit of that mindset is a maximization of data accessibility. Binary files require specific hardware and software to access, so users have two choices (1) retain in perpetuity the hardware and software necessary to access the data or (2) emulate the hardware and software.</p>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h3>Emulation</h3>
			<p>Similar to virtualization, emulation uses software to mimic hardware. However, in the case of emulation, the hardware is non-existent, and software translates hardware requests into the proper architecture and communicates with the actual hardware. (Incidentally, this is a popular practice for playing old console and arcade games on personal computers.)</p>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h3>Redundancy</h3>
			<p>System components can fail. A single point of failure is a failure that stops an entire system, and redundancy is designed to avoid this phenomenon. A duplicate site creates redundancy for an entire cloud. A server cluster, in addition to increasing availability by adding computing power to support multiple simultaneous client requests, allows alternative servers to take over when one server fails. Storage backups create duplicates of data in case storage devices become corrupted.</p>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h3>Full Backups</h3>
			<p>Full backups create a copy of all current data. The benefit of full backups are that only one restoration is necessary to bring the system back to the most recent backup. The drawback is that full backups are large. They store everything, which means that each object that existed prior to a backup is stored in every subsequent backup, as well.</p>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h3>Incremental Backups</h3>
			<p>Incremental backups only store the changes (deltas) since the previous backup. This is the backup method used by Git and other version control systems. In order to restore an entire backup, it is necessary to restore every delta. This process can become impossibly long. As a result, many backup solutions combine these two methods by having frequent incremental backups and infrequent full backups.</p>
		</section>

			<h3>Denied!</h3>
			<p>One major threat to system availability is denial of service (DoS). This involves sending a small network package (i.e., ping) to a server and asking for a response. If the number of pings becomes too large, this otherwise innocuous communication can overwhelm resources and effectively shutdown a server. Frequently, the attack is distributed across multiple clients in a distributed denial of service (DDoS) attack.</p>

			<h3>Processing Integrity</h3>
			<blockquote>System processing is complete, valid, accurate, timely and authorized.</blockquote>
			<p>The goal of every information system is to convert raw data into useful information by avoiding errors and corruption:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><u><i>Data validation</i></u> minimizes data entry and processing errors.</li>
				<li><u><i>Transaction processing</i></u> maintains integrity of database records.</li>
				<li><u><i>Refreshing</i></u> ensures that analyzed data is up-to-date.</li>
			</ul>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h3>Data Entry</h3>
			<p>Human intervention can always result in errors. Data validation minimizes the possibility of data entry errors in multiple forms:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><u><i>Data type</i></u> verifies that content has the correct data type.</li>
				<li><u><i>Check digits</i></u> determine that a string of digits follows allowable algorithms (e.g., credit cards, ISBN).</li>
				<li><u><i>Presence check</i></u> looks for missing values in a record.</li>
				<li><u><i>Range check</i></u> confirms that a value is between a predetermined minimum and maximum.</li>
				<li><u><i>Uniqueness check</i></u> ensures that unique values are not duplicated (e.g., usernames).</li>
				<li><u><i>Look-up check</i></u> limits selection to pre-existing values (e.g., approved vendors).</li>
			</ul>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h3>Data Processing</h3>
			<p>Data validation also minimizes errors in data processing. A common example is the batch or hash total, which looks for missing records when processing a group (or batch) of records by comparing a value for the group to the aggregation of individual values (e.g., total hours worked compared with the sum of hours worked in each record).</p>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h3>ACID</h3>
			<p>One of the biggest benefits of RDBMS and drawbacks of NoSQL is transaction processing, which prevents a transaction from only being partially completed. In order for a database to be transactional, it must satisfy ACID:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><u><i>Atomicity</i></u>: all changes happen or none happen.</li>
				<li><u><i>Consistency</i></u>: all actions as a group violate no constraints.</li>
				<li><u><i>Isolation</i></u>: each transaction is treated as occurring before or after, not during, any others.</li>
				<li><u><i>Durability</i></u>: each committed transaction's changes are permanent.</li>
			</ul>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h3>Refreshing</h3>
			<p>In a data warehousing environment, the transaction systems contain one version of the data, and the data warehouse and data marts contain another version. Accurate data analytics relies on current data in the warehouse, which requires periodic refreshing to bring the warehouse copy up to date.</p>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h3>Confidentiality</h3>
			<blockquote>Information designated as confidential is protected as committed or agreed.</blockquote>
			<p>Security and confidentiality both address the need to prevent unauthorized access, so many tools can serve both purposes. However, three tools commonly serve to keep information secret:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><u><i>Encryption</i></u> prevents reading sensitive content, especially in transit.</li>
				<li><u><i>Intermediation</i></u> anonymizes communication.</li>
				<li><u><i>Rights management</i></u> avoids unlicensed use of intellectual property.</li>
			</ul>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h3>Privacy</h3>
			<blockquote>Confidentiality is distinguished from privacy in that privacy deals with personal information whereas, confidentiality refers to a broader range of information that is not restricted to personal information.</blockquote>
			<p>Because of the inherent similarity between confidentiality and privacy, we will assume that similar tools preserve both.</p>

			<h3>Encryption</h3>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h3>Secure Shell</h3>
			<p>Some popular forms on communication rely on encryption. <u><i>Secure Shell</i></u> (SSH) allows remote access of a single computer using an encrypted connection. This is the current standard for accessing the command line of another computer, although it is also possible to tunnel graphical content through SSH. SSH is commonly considered a secure alternative to telnet, which historically was the standard for communication between two computers.</p>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h3>Virtual Private Network</h3>
			<p>SSH is useful for remotely accessing a single computer with an encrypted connection, but this is not always the desired goal. If an individual wants to access an entire LAN remotely, a <u><i>Virtual Private Network</i></u> (VPN) is necessary. A VPN uses RADIUS authentication to allow a WAN device to join a LAN. Because communication on a LAN should remain private, the connection between the WAN device and the LAN is encrypted. This is not only useful for telework, but also for preserving privacy when using a public WiFi network to access the Internet. As a result, many vendors sell subscription access to VPN servers.</p>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h3>Proxy Servers</h3>
			<p>Sometimes encrypted communication is not sufficient to maintain privacy because it is feasible to identify the source of the communication. Proxy servers redirect traffic and mask the source IP address to add anonymity. This is similar to the functionality of a private VPN, and given the choice, the encryption involved with a VPN makes it superior to a proxy server.</p>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h3>Rights Management</h3>
			<p>Intellectual property licenses dictate approved use of licensed content. Maintenance of rights metadata prevents authorized access and ensures prompt deletion of content with expired licenses. Also, rights management is inherently a required compliance activity when using licensed content.</p>
		</section>
		
		<section>
			<h3>Accounting Tie-in</h3>
			<p>Accounting architects have two perspectives on internal controls. The first comes from their role as architects. From this perspective controls are necessary to avoid the &ldquo;garbage in, garbage out&rdquo; problem. Information is only useful if it is derived from accurate data, and controls protect data integrity. Additionally, architects wish to preserve trade secrets. The second perspective is as accountants. Regulatory compliance dictates proper controls over the financial reporting process to ensure accurate financial statements. This is similar to the &ldquo;garbage in, garbage out&rdquo; principle, but in this case, the beneficiaries of the controls are external stakeholders.</p>
			<p>Employers want accountants to understand segregation of duties.</p>
