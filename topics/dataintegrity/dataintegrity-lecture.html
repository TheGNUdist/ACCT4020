			<h2>Systems Integrity</h2>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h3>Accounting Architecture</h3>
			<div class="flex-row">
				<div class="flex-item override"><img src="../../images/Arch5Color.png" alt="AA Arch" style="max-width: 300px"/></div>
				<div class="flex-item" style="max-width: 65%">
					<p>The final two blocks of the Control section are Availability and Processing Integrity. These terms correspond to matching concepts in the Trust Services Framework. Combined, these blocks prevent data loss and data errors.</p>
				</div>
			</div>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h3>Availability</h3>
			<blockquote>The system is available for operation and use as committed or agreed.</blockquote>
			<p>Two threats of availability are data loss and downtime. Three tools combat these threats:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><u><i>Interpretation</i></u> preserves accessibility of legacy data.</li>
				<li><u><i>Redundancy</i></u> avoids data loss and unplanned downtime.</li>
				<li><u><i>Change management</i></u> limits planned downtime.</li>
			</ul>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h3>Interpretation</h3>
			<p>I cannot say what the original reason was for the Unix philosophy that the basis of all data is plan text, but a significant benefit of that mindset is a maximization of data accessibility. Binary files require specific hardware and software to access, so users have two choices (1) retain in perpetuity the hardware and software necessary to access the data or (2) emulate the hardware and software.</p>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h3>Emulation</h3>
			<p>Similar to virtualization, emulation uses software to mimic hardware. However, in the case of emulation, the hardware is non-existent, and software translates hardware requests into the proper architecture and communicates with the actual hardware. (Incidentally, this is a popular practice for playing old console and arcade games on personal computers.)</p>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h3>Redundancy</h3>
			<p>System components can fail. A single point of failure is a failure that stops an entire system, and redundancy is designed to avoid this phenomenon. A duplicate site creates redundancy for an entire cloud. A server cluster, in addition to increasing availability by adding computing power to support multiple simultaneous client requests, allows alternative servers to take over when one server fails. Storage backups create duplicates of data in case storage devices become corrupted.</p>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h3>RAID</h3>
			<p>The lowest level of logical volume that we will consider is the Redundant Array of Independent Disks (RAID). A RAID combines multiple physical disks or volumes into a group of logical volumes. RAID can take on many forms, and each form has a number. RAID 0 involves combining two physical volumes into one logical volume, called a <em>stripe</em>, so that the file system only sees a single drive with the storage capacity of both physical volumes combined.</li>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h3>Full Backups</h3>
			<p>Full backups create a copy of all current data. The benefit of full backups are that only one restoration is necessary to bring the system back to the most recent backup. The drawback is that full backups are large. They store everything, which means that each object that existed prior to a backup is stored in every subsequent backup, as well.</p>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h3>Incremental Backups</h3>
			<p>Incremental backups only store the changes (deltas) since the previous backup. This is the backup method used by Git and other version control systems. In order to restore an entire backup, it is necessary to restore every delta. This process can become impossibly long. As a result, many backup solutions combine these two methods by having frequent incremental backups and infrequent full backups.</p>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h3>Denied!</h3>
			<p>One major threat to system availability is denial of service (DoS). This involves sending a small network package (i.e., ping) to a server and asking for a response. If the number of pings becomes too large, this otherwise innocuous communication can overwhelm resources and effectively shutdown a server. Frequently, the attack is distributed across multiple clients in a distributed denial of service (DDoS) attack.</p>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h3>Processing Integrity</h3>
			<blockquote>System processing is complete, valid, accurate, timely and authorized.</blockquote>
			<p>The goal of every information system is to convert raw data into useful information by avoiding errors and corruption:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><u><i>Data validation</i></u> minimizes data entry and processing errors.</li>
				<li><u><i>Transaction processing</i></u> maintains integrity of database records.</li>
				<li><u><i>Refreshing</i></u> ensures that analyzed data is up-to-date.</li>
			</ul>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h3>Cryptographic Hash</h3>
			<p>Even though cipher text is not human- or computer-readable, it can still provide useful information even when decryption is not possible. In fact, some encryption keys (e.g., MD5) are designed to create a cipher text that cannot be decrypted. The purpose in this case is not to protect a message in transit but rather to verify the integrity of the data. Verification has two components. The first involves confirming that the data has not been modified, and the second involves confirming the identify of the sender.</p>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h3>Data Entry</h3>
			<p>Human intervention can always result in errors. Data validation minimizes the possibility of data entry errors in multiple forms:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><u><i>Data type</i></u> verifies that content has the correct data type.</li>
				<li><u><i>Check digits</i></u> determine that a string of digits follows allowable algorithms (e.g., credit cards, ISBN).</li>
				<li><u><i>Presence check</i></u> looks for missing values in a record.</li>
				<li><u><i>Range check</i></u> confirms that a value is between a predetermined minimum and maximum.</li>
				<li><u><i>Uniqueness check</i></u> ensures that unique values are not duplicated (e.g., usernames).</li>
				<li><u><i>Look-up check</i></u> limits selection to pre-existing values (e.g., approved vendors).</li>
			</ul>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h3>Data Processing</h3>
			<p>Data validation also minimizes errors in data processing. A common example is the batch or hash total, which looks for missing records when processing a group (or batch) of records by comparing a value for the group to the aggregation of individual values (e.g., total hours worked compared with the sum of hours worked in each record).</p>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h3>ACID</h3>
			<p>One of the biggest benefits of RDBMS and drawbacks of NoSQL is transaction processing, which prevents a transaction from only being partially completed. In order for a database to be transactional, it must satisfy ACID:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><u><i>Atomicity</i></u>: all changes happen or none happen.</li>
				<li><u><i>Consistency</i></u>: all actions as a group violate no constraints.</li>
				<li><u><i>Isolation</i></u>: each transaction is treated as occurring before or after, not during, any others.</li>
				<li><u><i>Durability</i></u>: each committed transaction's changes are permanent.</li>
			</ul>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h3>Refreshing</h3>
			<p>In a data warehousing environment, the transaction systems contain one version of the data, and the data warehouse and data marts contain another version. Accurate data analytics relies on current data in the warehouse, which requires periodic refreshing to bring the warehouse copy up to date.</p>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h3>Redundancies</h3>
			<p>The benefits of a database system rely on the avoidance of redundancy. In fact, one of the reasons to transition from a file system to a database system is to avoid redundancies from separate individuals tracking information in separate flat files. However, redundancies can also arise in database systems through the creation of <u><i>functional dependencies</i></u>. These dependencies create problematic <u><i>create</i></u>, <u><i>update</i></u>, and <u><i>delete anomalies</i></u>.</p>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h3>Partial Dependencies</h3>
			<p>A <u><i>partial dependency</i></u> arises if a non-key attribute (i.e., an attribute that is not a primary key) depends on only part of a composite key. Again using the example of the course list, the composite key Semester, Year, Course, and Section identifies a unique record. However, the attribute Course Name exclusively depends on Course, which is only part of the composite key.</p>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h3>Transitive Dependencies</h3>
			<p>A <u><i>transitive dependency</i></u> arises when a non-key attribute is dependent on another non-key attribute. For example, the entity Employee might include Employee ID, Employee Name, Department ID and Department Name. Employee ID is the primary key, and the employee's department (Department ID) depends on Employee ID. However, Department Name depends on Department ID, which is not a primary key. This is a transitive dependency because Employee ID &rarr; Department ID &rarr; Department Name, which creates a transitive link between Employee ID and Department Name.</p>
		</section>

			<h3>Create Anomaly</h3>
			<p>The <u><i>create anomaly</i></u> arises when it is not possible to add a record to a table because the new record has no value for the primary key. For example, suppose the Inventory table with SKU as primary key includes the name, address, and contact info for the vendor. The company wishes to add an approved vendor to the vendor list, but the company has not yet identified with items to order from that vendor. It is not possible to add that vendor to the database because no value for the primary key SKU exists.</p>
			<div class="table" style="font-size: 20px; border: 3px solid black">
				<div class="table-row" style="background-color: lightgray; border-bottom: 1px solid black">
					<div class="table-cell" style="font-weight: bold">SKU</div>

					<div class="table-cell">123 Tool Drive</div>
					<div class="table-cell">888-555-1234</div>
				</div>
			</div>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h3>Update Anomaly</h3>
			<p>Repeating groups cause the <u><i>update anomaly</i></u>, which involves needing to change the same value more than once. If the Inventory table includes vendor contact info, and the vendor carries more than one inventory item, and the contact information for the vendor changes, it is necessary to find all references to that vendor in the table and update each separately.</p>
			<div class="table" style="font-size: 20px; border: 3px solid black">
				<div class="table-row" style="background-color: lightgray; border-bottom: 1px solid black">
					<div class="table-cell" style="font-weight: bold">SKU</div>

					<div class="table-cell" style="color: red; font-weight: bold">800-555-1234</div>
				</div>
			</div>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h3>Delete Anomaly</h3>
			<p>The <u><i>delete anomaly</i></u> is the loss of unintended information when a record is removed. If the Inventory table includes vendor contact info, and the company decides to discontinue the only item carried by that vendor, deleting the inventory record will also delete the vendor contact info even if the company intended to business with that vendor in the future.</p>
			<div class="table" style="font-size: 20px; border: 3px solid black">
				<div class="table-row" style="background-color: lightgray; border-bottom: 1px solid black">

				</div>
			</div>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h3>Normalization</h3>
			<p><u><i>Normalization</i></u> removes functional dependencies and their resulting anomalies by dividing tables with dependencies into multiple tables connected by foreign keys. Second normal form (2NF) removes partial dependencies, and third normal form (3NF) removes transitive dependencies. First normal form (1NF) also resolves anomalies, but it is too simplistic for our purposes. Third normal form is the minimum standard for a well-defined database.</p>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h3>Example</h3>
			<p>Using the example listed previously when introducing anomalies, normalize the Inventory table:</p>
			<div class="table" style="font-size: 20px; border: 3px solid black">
				<div class="table-row" style="background-color: lightgray; border-bottom: 1px solid black">
					<div class="table-cell" style="font-weight: bold">SKU</div>
					<div class="table-cell" style="font-weight: bold">Description</div>
					<div class="table-cell" style="font-weight: bold">Vendor Name</div>
					<div class="table-cell" style="font-weight: bold">Vendor Address</div>
					<div class="table-cell" style="font-weight: bold">Vendor Phone</div>
				</div>
			</div>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h3>Solution</h3>
			<p>The anomalies occur because of the decision to store inventory and vendor information together. Normalization splits the original table into two which Vendor Name as the primary key of the newly created Vendor table and the foreign key in the Inventory table:</p>
			<div style="font-size: 24px">Inventory Table</div>
			<div class="table" style="font-size: 20px; border: 3px solid black; margin-bottom: 50px">
				<div class="table-row" style="background-color: lightgray; border-bottom: 1px solid black">
					<div class="table-cell" style="font-weight: bold">SKU</div>
					<div class="table-cell" style="font-weight: bold">Description</div>
					<div class="table-cell" style="font-weight: bold">Vendor Name</div>
				</div>
			</div>
			<div style="font-size: 24px">Vendor Table</div>
			<div class="table" style="font-size: 20px; border: 3px solid black">
				<div class="table-row" style="background-color: lightgray; border-bottom: 1px solid black">
					<div class="table-cell" style="font-weight: bold">Vendor Name</div>
					<div class="table-cell" style="font-weight: bold">Vendor Address</div>
					<div class="table-cell" style="font-weight: bold">Vendor Phone</div>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p>(Using this technique, can you successfully normalize the other tables used to depict transitory and partial dependencies?)</p>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h3>Many-to-Many</h3>
			<p>One indication that a dependency exists is a relationship between two tables with maximum cardinalities of &ldquo;many&rdquo; in both directions. The resolution of this issue is a <u><i>linking table</i></u> that includes the primary keys of both original entities as a composite primary key. Because these are also the primary keys of another entity, they are simultaneously primary and foreign keys.</p>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h3>Normalizing an E-R diagram</h3>
			<div class="flex-row">
				<div class="flex-item override"><img src="../../images/unnormalized.png" alt="Unnormalized Table" style="max-width: 200px"/></div>
				<div class="flex-item" style="max-width: 75%">
					<p>This E-R diagram entity lists common attributes for a sales order. (By the way, extension is unit price multiplied by quantity.) However, it is not 3NF. Construct an E-R diagram that includes each of these attributes&mdash;except those that meet the criteria in the &ldquo;Exceptions to Entities and Attributes&rdquo; slide&mdash;in a set of 3NF entities.</p>
				</div>
			</div>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h3>Customer</h3>
			<div class="flex-row">
				<div class="flex-item override"><img src="../../images/normal-step1.png" alt="Step 1" style="max-width: 475px"/></div>
				<div class="flex-item" style="max-width: 50%">
					<p>First, we create a Customer entity. By storing this data in a separate table, we avoid duplicating it each time that the customer places a new order. We select the customer's email address as a primary key [PK] because customer accounts are frequently identified by the email address.</p>
				</div>
			</div>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h3>Carrier</h3>
			<div class="flex-row">
				<div class="flex-item override"><img src="../../images/normal-step2.png" alt="Step 2" style="max-width: 475px"/></div>
				<div class="flex-item" style="max-width: 50%">
					<p>Second, we create a Carrier entity to avoid duplicating carrier information for each order. The Carrier ID primary key could simply enumerate the carriers (i.e., 001, 002, 003, etc.). Not all primary keys have any interpretation. Sometimes they are nonsensical and only serve to uniquely identify records.</p>
				</div>
			</div>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h3>Inventory</h3>
			<div class="flex-row">
				<div class="flex-item override"><img src="../../images/normal-step3.png" alt="Step 3" style="max-width: 475px"/></div>
				<div class="flex-item" style="max-width: 50%">
					<p>Third, we create an Inventory entity. Although quantity on hand is not normally on a sales order, it is an important Inventory attribute, so we add it to the Inventory table. SKU is an inventory identifier that is common to vendor and customer, so we can use it as an informative primary key.</p>
				</div>
			</div>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h3>Sales Tax</h3>
			<div class="flex-row">
				<div class="flex-item override"><img src="../../images/normal-step4.png" alt="Step 4" style="max-width: 475px"/></div>
				<div class="flex-item" style="max-width: 50%">
					<p>Fourth, we create a Sales Tax entity to store the sales tax rates for each jurisdiction. Because jurisdictions are frequently identified by ZIP code, we can use that as the primary key.</p>
				</div>
			</div>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h3>Relationships</h3>
			<div class="flex-row">
				<div class="flex-item override"><img src="../../images/normal-step5.png" alt="Step 5" style="max-width: 475px"/></div>
				<div class="flex-item" style="max-width: 50%">
					<p>Next, we assign relationships to the entities and cardinalities to the relationships. This involves some assumptions based on hypothetical business rules. Each customer is associated with at least zero and at most many sales orders. Each carrier is associated with at least zero and at most many sales orders. Each sales order is associated with exactly one customer and one carrier.</p>
				</div>
			</div>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h3>Relationships</h3>
			<div class="flex-row">
				<div class="flex-item override"><img src="../../images/normal-step6.png" alt="Step 6" style="max-width: 475px"/></div>
				<div class="flex-item" style="max-width: 50%">
					<p>Although sales tax applies to a sales order, the customer's ZIP code resides in the Customer table. As a result, we will link the Sales Tax entity with the Customer entity with the assumption that each customer (by virtue of the customer's address) is associated with one sales tax rate, while each ZIP is associated with at least zero and at most many customers.</p>
				</div>
			</div>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h3>Relationships</h3>
			<div class="flex-row">
				<div class="flex-item override"><img src="../../images/normal-step7.png" alt="Step 7" style="max-width: 475px"/></div>
				<div class="flex-item" style="max-width: 50%">
					<p>Finally, each sales order is associated with at least one and at most many inventory items, and each inventory item can be associated with at least zero and at most many sales orders. This many-to-many relationship is a problem, which a linking table will fix.</p>
				</div>
			</div>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h3>Foreign Keys</h3>
			<div class="flex-row">
				<div class="flex-item override"><img src="../../images/normal-step8.png" alt="Step 8" style="max-width: 475px"/></div>
				<div class="flex-item" style="max-width: 50%">
					<p>Before creating a linking table, we add foreign keys to operationalize relationships. Customer email, carrier ID, and SKU are foreign keys in the Sales Order table, and ZIP, which already was an attribute of the Customer entity becomes a foreign key. This links customer ZIP to sales tax rate, and it restricts customers to ZIP codes already in the Sales Tax table.</p>
