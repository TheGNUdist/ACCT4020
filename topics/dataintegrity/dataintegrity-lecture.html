			<h2>Systems Integrity</h2>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h3>Accounting Architecture</h3>
			<div class="flex-row">
				<div class="flex-item override"><img src="../../images/Arch5Color.png" alt="AA Arch" style="max-width: 300px"/></div>
				<div class="flex-item" style="max-width: 65%">
					<p>The final two blocks of the Control section are Availability and Processing Integrity. These terms correspond to matching concepts in the Trust Services Framework. Combined, these blocks prevent data loss and data errors.</p>
				</div>
			</div>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h3>Availability</h3>
			<blockquote>The system is available for operation and use as committed or agreed.</blockquote>
			<p>Two threats of availability are data loss and downtime. Three tools combat these threats:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><u><i>Interpretation</i></u> preserves accessibility of legacy data.</li>
				<li><u><i>Change management</i></u> limits planned downtime.</li>
				<li><u><i>Redundancy</i></u> avoids data loss and unplanned downtime.</li>
			</ul>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h3>Denied!</h3>
			<p>One major threat to the availability of a cloud system is denial of service (DoS). This involves sending a small network package (i.e., ping) to a server and asking for a response. If the number of pings becomes too large, this otherwise innocuous communication can overwhelm resources and effectively shutdown a server. Frequently, the attack is distributed across multiple clients in a distributed denial of service (DDoS) attack. Firewalls can prevent servers from responding to pings and protect them from DoS attacks. This is just one example of the interplay between Security and Availability.</p>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h3>Interpretation</h3>
			<p>One of the Unix philosophies was that the basis of all data is plain text&mdash;as opposed to complied binary files, not as opposed to encrypted files. Although the advent of graphical interfaces has made this infeasible, one of the benefits of this philosophy is a maximization of data accessibility. Any system can read plain text files, whereas binary files require specific hardware and software to access. In order to preserve interpretability of binary files, users have two choices (1) retain in perpetuity the hardware and software necessary to access the data or (2) emulate the hardware and software.</p>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h3>Emulation</h3>
			<p>In virtualization, the hypervisor virtualizes computer hardware. In containerization, the container virtualizes the operating system kernel. Emulation is similar to virtualization in that the emulator virtualizes computer hardware. However, in the case of emulation, the hardware is non-existent, and the emulator must translate hardware requests intended for the emulated hardware before communicating with the computer's actual hardware. (Incidentally, this is a popular practice for playing old console and arcade games on personal computers.)</p>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h3>Patching</h3>
			<p>Every information system needs hardware and software updates (i.e., patches) sooner or later. Although Linux developers, specifically Red Hat and SUSE, have provided methods for updating the Linux kernel without needing to reboot, hardware and software patches sometimes require shutting down or restarting a system. During these periods, any data is unavailable, and any externally facing systems are inaccessible to customers. This can result in a loss of business, data collection and analysis, and customer satisfaction.</p>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h3>Change Management</h3>
			<p>Proper change management (i.e., processes that govern system changes and updates) can minimize the negative effects of downtime by (1) scheduling downtime when it would inconvenience the fewest users and (2) structuring patches to reduce the likelihood of breakage following an update. Because all systems need patching, internal and external users understand the need for system maintenance and can schedule necessary activities around planned, announced maintenance windows. During these maintenance windows, it is important to make quick updates that will not break existing functionality.</p>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h3>DevOps</h3>
			<p>In order to ensure that system patches will work and not break functionality, developers, especially in-house developers, who wrote the code, and IT staff, who maintain the hardware and software, must work together in order to ensure that the system will run smoothly after the update. This is the premise of <u><i>DevOps</i></u>, which is, intuitively, a combination of &ldquo;Development&rdquo; and &ldquo;Operations.&rdquo; Business-led IT is an outcropping of this, in which the DevOps team expands to include business experts. Accounting Architecture is essentially business-led IT applied to the financial and management accounting, auditing, and tax functions.</p>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h3>Redundancy</h3>
			<p>System components can fail. A <u><i>single point of failure</i></u> is a failure that stops an entire system, and redundancy is designed to avoid this phenomenon. A duplicate site (i.e., server room) creates redundancy for an entire cloud. A server cluster, in addition to increasing availability by adding processing power, allows alternative servers to take over when one server fails. Storage backups create duplicates of data in case storage volumes become corrupted.</p>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h3>RAID 1</h3>
			<p>RAID 0 involves combining two physical volumes into one logical volume, called a <em>stripe</em>, so that the file system only sees a single drive with the storage capacity of both physical volumes combined. The purpose of RAID 0 is maximize the size of a logical volume. Interestingly, one of the problems with RAID 0 is its vulnerability to failure because the stripe becomes corrupted if either physical volume fails. RAID 1, on the other hand, uses the same to physical volumes as mirrors. The user only sees one of the two drives, and the other is a backup. Because data integrity is more important that storage capacity, RAID 1 is generally more popular than RAID 0.</li>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h3>Pros and Cons</h3>
			<p>RAID 1 is one backup method, and this method has some advantages and disadvantages over periodic, full backups. The primary advantage is that the RAID make continuous, real-time backups, so no data is ever not duplicated. Additionally, the RAID system is designed to repair volumes while the system is live, so if one drive becomes corrupted, it is possible to swap out that drive, replace it with a blank one, and have the RAID rebuild the data without ever shutting down the system. The primary advantage of periodic, full backups is the ability to store the backup off-site (e.g., in another office building, with a security company, or in a safety deposit box) to avoid data loss should the computer hosting the RAID become damaged or stolen.</p>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h3>Full vs. Incremental</h3>
			<p>Full backups create a complete copy of all data during each backup. As a result, each subsequent backup contains the data stored in all earlier backups. Because it is generally good practice to keep more than one backup (e.g., three weeks of daily backups) full backups can quickly become infeasibly large. Fortunately, incremental backups provide another option for storing backups off-site. Incremental backups only store the changes (deltas) since the previous backup. In order to restore an entire incremental backup, it is necessary to restore every delta. This process can become infeasibly long.</p>
		</section>
		
		<section>
			<h3>Easier is not Better</h3>
			<p>One option for reducing the size of full backups or the restoration time of incremental backups is to decrease the frequency of backups (e.g., once a week, instead of once a day). The problem with this option is that the expected loss of additional data may be unacceptable. For example, if the current policy is daily backups and a storage volume fails immediately before that day's backup, at most 24 hours worth of data is irreplaceable. If that policy changes to weekly backups and a storage volumes fails immediately before that week's backup, as much as 168 hours of data is lost! For a large company, that may be tens of millions of database records.</p>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h3>Best of Both Worlds</h3>
			<p>A safer option of reducing the size of full backups or the restoration time of incremental backups is to combine the concepts of full and incremental backups by having frequent incremental backups and infrequent full backups. For example, a policy might dictate weekly full backups and daily incremental backups. This reduces the combined size of all full backups and the restoration time of all incremental backups because restoration would only require the previous full backup and one incremental backup for each day between the last full backup and the failure.</p>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h3>Version Control System</h3>
			<p>One common incremental backup tool, especially among developers, is the <u><i>version control system</i></u>, such as Git. These storage solutions offer unique advantages over other backup tools. First, they simultaneously promote backup and real-time collaboration. In fact, because of the decentralized nature of these systems, additional collaboration always promotes additional backups because each collaborator has a full copy of the data store. Second, the system manages incremental backups smartly, provides a convenient timeline of changes, and allows for straightforward file restoration on an individual user basis. Finally, with minimal additional work, these systems can create both local and cloud backups (e.g., GitHub).</p>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h3>Processing Integrity</h3>
			<blockquote>System processing is complete, valid, accurate, timely and authorized.</blockquote>
			<p>The goal of every information system is to convert raw data into useful information by avoiding errors and corruption:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><u><i>Data validation</i></u> and <u><i>transaction processing</i></u> minimize data entry and processing errors.</li>
				<li><u><i>Refreshing</i></u> ensures that analyzed data is up-to-date.</li>
				<li><u><i>Normalization</i></u> maintains the integrity of database records.</li>
			</ul>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h3>Data Entry</h3>
			<p>Human intervention can always result in errors. Data validation minimizes the possibility of data entry errors in multiple forms:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><u><i>Data type</i></u> verifies that content has the correct data type.</li>
				<li><u><i>Check digits</i></u> determine that a string of digits follows allowable algorithms (e.g., credit cards, ISBN).</li>
				<li><u><i>Presence check</i></u> looks for missing values in a record.</li>
				<li><u><i>Range check</i></u> confirms that a value is between a predetermined minimum and maximum.</li>
				<li><u><i>Uniqueness check</i></u> ensures that unique values are not duplicated (e.g., usernames).</li>
				<li><u><i>Look-up check</i></u> limits selection to pre-existing values (e.g., states in the US).</li>
			</ul>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h3>Hashes</h3>
			<p>Encryption is not only for preserving confidentiality. Because a cryptographic hash of a data object changes if the data changes, encryption is also useful for determining data validity. However, not all hashes are cryptographic, and in situations where confidentiality is not a concern, plain text hashes can be useful. A plain text hash is essentially the nonsensical result of a mathematical equation involving numbers that have no numerical interpretation. For example, a hash might be the sum of all invoice numbers or all employee SSNs. The purpose of these hashes is also to confirm data validity, frequently during batch processing to verify that the batch is complete and has no missing records.</p>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h3>ACID</h3>
			<p>One of the biggest benefits of RDBMS and drawbacks of NoSQL is transaction processing, which prevents a transaction from only being partially completed. In order for a database to be transactional, it must satisfy ACID:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><u><i>Atomicity</i></u>: all changes happen or none happen.</li>
				<li><u><i>Consistency</i></u>: all actions as a group violate no constraints.</li>
				<li><u><i>Isolation</i></u>: each transaction is treated as occurring before or after, not during, any others.</li>
				<li><u><i>Durability</i></u>: each committed transaction's changes are permanent.</li>
			</ul>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h3>Refreshing</h3>
			<p>In a data warehousing environment, the transaction systems contain one version of the data, and the data warehouse and data marts contain another version. Accurate data analytics relies on current data in the warehouse, which requires periodic refreshing to bring the warehouse copy up to date.</p>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h3>Redundancies</h3>
			<p>The benefits of a database system rely on the avoidance of redundancy. In fact, one of the reasons to transition from a file system to a database system is to avoid redundancies from separate individuals tracking information in separate flat files. However, redundancies can also arise in database systems through the creation of <u><i>functional dependencies</i></u>. These dependencies create problematic <u><i>create</i></u>, <u><i>update</i></u>, and <u><i>delete anomalies</i></u>.</p>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h3>Partial Dependencies</h3>
			<p>A <u><i>partial dependency</i></u> arises if a non-key attribute (i.e., an attribute that is not a primary key) depends on only part of a composite key. Again using the example of the course list, the composite key Semester, Year, Course, and Section identifies a unique record. However, the attribute Course Name exclusively depends on Course, which is only part of the composite key.</p>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h3>Transitive Dependencies</h3>
			<p>A <u><i>transitive dependency</i></u> arises when a non-key attribute is dependent on another non-key attribute. For example, the entity Employee might include Employee ID, Employee Name, Department ID and Department Name. Employee ID is the primary key, and the employee's department (Department ID) depends on Employee ID. However, Department Name depends on Department ID, which is not a primary key. This is a transitive dependency because Employee ID &rarr; Department ID &rarr; Department Name, which creates a transitive link between Employee ID and Department Name.</p>

			<h3>Create Anomaly</h3>
			<p>The <u><i>create anomaly</i></u> arises when it is not possible to add a record to a table because the new record has no value for the primary key. For example, suppose the Inventory table with SKU as primary key includes the name, address, and contact info for the vendor. The company wishes to add an approved vendor to the vendor list, but the company has not yet identified with items to order from that vendor. It is not possible to add that vendor to the database because no value for the primary key SKU exists.</p>
			<div class="table" style="font-size: 20px; border: 3px solid black">
				<div class="table-row" style="background-color: lightgray; border-bottom: 1px solid black">
					<div class="table-cell" style="font-weight: bold">SKU</div>

					<div class="table-cell">123 Tool Drive</div>
					<div class="table-cell">888-555-1234</div>
				</div>
			</div>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h3>Update Anomaly</h3>
			<p>Repeating groups cause the <u><i>update anomaly</i></u>, which involves needing to change the same value more than once. If the Inventory table includes vendor contact info, and the vendor carries more than one inventory item, and the contact information for the vendor changes, it is necessary to find all references to that vendor in the table and update each separately.</p>
			<div class="table" style="font-size: 20px; border: 3px solid black">
				<div class="table-row" style="background-color: lightgray; border-bottom: 1px solid black">
					<div class="table-cell" style="font-weight: bold">SKU</div>

				</div>
			</div>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h3>Delete Anomaly</h3>
			<p>The <u><i>delete anomaly</i></u> is the loss of unintended information when a record is removed. If the Inventory table includes vendor contact info, and the company decides to discontinue the only item carried by that vendor, deleting the inventory record will also delete the vendor contact info even if the company intended to business with that vendor in the future.</p>

		</section>

		<section>
			<h3>Normalization</h3>
			<p><u><i>Normalization</i></u> removes functional dependencies and their resulting anomalies by dividing tables with dependencies into multiple tables connected by foreign keys. Second normal form (2NF) removes partial dependencies, and third normal form (3NF) removes transitive dependencies. First normal form (1NF) also resolves anomalies, but it is too simplistic for our purposes. Third normal form is the minimum standard for a well-defined database.</p>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h3>Example</h3>
			<p>Using the example listed previously when introducing anomalies, normalize the Inventory table:</p>
			<div class="table" style="font-size: 20px; border: 3px solid black">
				<div class="table-row" style="background-color: lightgray; border-bottom: 1px solid black">
					<div class="table-cell" style="font-weight: bold">SKU</div>
					<div class="table-cell" style="font-weight: bold">Description</div>
					<div class="table-cell" style="font-weight: bold">Vendor Name</div>
					<div class="table-cell" style="font-weight: bold">Vendor Address</div>
					<div class="table-cell" style="font-weight: bold">Vendor Phone</div>
				</div>
			</div>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h3>Solution</h3>
			<p>The anomalies occur because of the decision to store inventory and vendor information together. Normalization splits the original table into two which Vendor Name as the primary key of the newly created Vendor table and the foreign key in the Inventory table:</p>
			<div style="font-size: 24px">Inventory Table</div>
			<div class="table" style="font-size: 20px; border: 3px solid black; margin-bottom: 50px">
				<div class="table-row" style="background-color: lightgray; border-bottom: 1px solid black">
					<div class="table-cell" style="font-weight: bold">SKU</div>
					<div class="table-cell" style="font-weight: bold">Description</div>
					<div class="table-cell" style="font-weight: bold">Vendor Name</div>
				</div>
			</div>
			<div style="font-size: 24px">Vendor Table</div>
			<div class="table" style="font-size: 20px; border: 3px solid black">
				<div class="table-row" style="background-color: lightgray; border-bottom: 1px solid black">
					<div class="table-cell" style="font-weight: bold">Vendor Name</div>
					<div class="table-cell" style="font-weight: bold">Vendor Address</div>
					<div class="table-cell" style="font-weight: bold">Vendor Phone</div>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p>(Using this technique, can you successfully normalize the other tables used to depict transitory and partial dependencies?)</p>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h3>Many-to-Many</h3>
			<p>One indication that a dependency exists is a relationship between two tables with maximum cardinalities of &ldquo;many&rdquo; in both directions. The resolution of this issue is a <u><i>linking table</i></u> that includes the primary keys of both original entities as a composite primary key. Because these are also the primary keys of another entity, they are simultaneously primary and foreign keys.</p>
		</section>

			<h3>Normalizing an E-R diagram</h3>
			<div class="flex-row">
				<div class="flex-item override"><img src="../../images/unnormalized.png" alt="Unnormalized Table" style="max-width: 200px"/></div>
				<div class="flex-item" style="max-width: 75%">
					<p>This E-R diagram entity lists common attributes for a sales order. (By the way, extension is unit price multiplied by quantity.) However, it is not 3NF. Construct an E-R diagram that includes each of these attributes&mdash;except those constitute exceptions to attributes because they are functions of other attributes&mdash;in a set of 3NF entities.</p>

			<h3>Customer</h3>
			<div class="flex-row">
				<div class="flex-item override"><img src="../../images/normal-step1.png" alt="Step 1" style="max-width: 475px"/></div>
				<div class="flex-item" style="max-width: 50%">
					<p>First, we create a Customer entity. By storing this data in a separate table, we avoid duplicating it each time that the customer places a new order. We select the customer's email address as a primary key [PK] because customer accounts are frequently identified by the email address.</p>
				</div>
			</div>

		<section>
			<h3>Carrier</h3>
			<div class="flex-row">
				<div class="flex-item override"><img src="../../images/normal-step2.png" alt="Step 2" style="max-width: 475px"/></div>
				<div class="flex-item" style="max-width: 50%">
					<p>Second, we create a Carrier entity to avoid duplicating carrier information for each order. The Carrier ID primary key could simply enumerate the carriers (i.e., 001, 002, 003, etc.). Not all primary keys have any interpretation. Sometimes they are nonsensical and only serve to uniquely identify records.</p>
				</div>
			</div>

			<h3>Inventory</h3>
			<div class="flex-row">

				<div class="flex-item" style="max-width: 50%">
					<p>Third, we create an Inventory entity. Although quantity on hand is not normally on a sales order, it is an important Inventory attribute, so we add it to the Inventory table. SKU is an inventory identifier that is common to vendor and customer, so we can use it as an informative primary key.</p>

			<h3>Sales Tax</h3>

				<div class="flex-item" style="max-width: 50%">
					<p>Fourth, we create a Sales Tax entity to store the sales tax rates for each jurisdiction. Because jurisdictions are frequently identified by ZIP code, we can use that as the primary key.</p>

				<div class="flex-item" style="max-width: 50%">
					<p>Next, we assign relationships to the entities and cardinalities to the relationships. This involves some assumptions based on hypothetical business rules. Each customer is associated with at least zero and at most many sales orders. Each carrier is associated with at least zero and at most many sales orders. Each sales order is associated with exactly one customer and one carrier.</p>

					<p>Although sales tax applies to a sales order, the customer's ZIP code resides in the Customer table. As a result, we will link the Sales Tax entity with the Customer entity with the assumption that each customer (by virtue of the customer's address) is associated with one sales tax rate, while each ZIP is associated with at least zero and at most many customers.</p>

					<p>Finally, each sales order is associated with at least one and at most many inventory items, and each inventory item can be associated with at least zero and at most many sales orders. This many-to-many relationship is a problem, which a linking table will fix.</p>

					<p>Before creating a linking table, we add foreign keys to operationalize relationships. Customer email, carrier ID, and SKU are foreign keys in the Sales Order table, and ZIP, which already was an attribute of the Customer entity becomes a foreign key. This links customer ZIP to sales tax rate, and it restricts customers to ZIP codes already in the Sales Tax table.</p>
