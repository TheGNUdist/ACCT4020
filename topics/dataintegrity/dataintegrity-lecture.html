			<h2>Control</h2>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h3>Accounting Architecture</h3>
			<div class="flex-row">
				<div class="flex-item override"><img src="../../images/Arch5Color.png" alt="AA Arch" style="max-width: 300px"/></div>
				<div class="flex-item" style="max-width: 65%">
					<p>Information is the keystone of any information system, and Technology is the set of tools necessary to implement that system. Control, however, is a choice. A system can function without proper controls. However, a system without proper controls exposes internal and external stakeholders to risks. The different blocks in the Control section represent different control objectives.</p>
				</div>
			</div>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h3>External Stakeholders</h3>
			<p>Accountants care about external stakeholders. Financial accounting regulations exist to protect external stakeholders from misinformation. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles dictate the creation of financial statements to maximize comparability between firms. The Sarbanes-Oxley Act requires firms to implement internal controls over financial reporting to prevent misstatements in the financial statements. [more about SOX]</p>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h3>Risk Aversion</h3>
			<p>The foundation of the architecture implies the need for controls to satisfy regulatory compliance. However, that is not enough to satisfy external stakeholders. Although these are not always protected by regulation, external stakeholders are generally unwilling to tolerate breaches of privacy, loss of data relevant to them, and system unavailability. (Just think of how you would feel if your email, or heaven forbid your SMS service, stopped working.) Frequently, external parties draft contracts to protect themselves from these risks, so again the Compliance block becomes relevant for satisfying the demands of these external stakeholders.</p>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h3>Internal Stakeholders</h3>
			<p>Regulations and contracts generally would not cover internal stakeholders, but just as external stakeholders, they wish to avoid misinformation, which would result in misled strategic decisions, and to protect their privacy (although <i>confidentiality</i> would be a more appropriate term in this context). Because internal stakeholders are the biggest &ldquo;customer&rdquo; of the information system, protect them from risks becomes are primary goal of information system controls.</p>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h3><i>Cost</i>-Benefit Analysis</h3>
			<p>Three different types of controls exist: preventive, detective, and corrective. Any implementation of controls is costly, although 100% prevention would clearly be the best, the cost is prohibitive. As a result, the only cost effective solution involves a combination of all three types: preventing what can be prevented and detecting and correcting what cannot be prevented.</p>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h3>Cost-<i>Benefit</i> Analysis</h3>
			<p>The benefit of a control implementation is the reduction in either the <u><i>likelihood</i></u> of or <u><i>exposure</i></u> to unauthorized access, data loss, or data corruption. Likelihood is the probability of a problem, and exposure is the dollar loss from litigation, fines, lost business, cost of restoring a system and its data, etc., should a problem occur. The size of the loss can make a problem with a small likelihood a big problem, especially when regulatory compliance is very strict. Preventive controls can lower the likelihood of a problem, and detective and corrective controls can reduce the exposure (i.e., make a problem less bad or fix a problem more quickly). </p>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h3>Control Framework</h3>
			<p>Many control system frameworks exist that address the various types of risk that external and internal stakeholders face. Three well-known examples are (1) Internal Control&ndash;Integrated Framework and (2) Enterprise Risk Management&ndash;Integrated Framework by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) and (3) Control Objectives for Information and Related Technology (COBIT) by the Information Systems and Audit Control Association (ISACA). These are dense and comprehensive, though not necessarily comprehensible, so I have opted for the simpler AICPA Trust Services Framework.</p>
		</section>
		
		<section>
			<h3>Trust Services Framework</h3>
			<div class="flex-row">
				<div class="flex-item override"><img src="../../images/trust-services.png" alt="Trust Services Framework" style="max-width: 300px"/></div>
				<div class="flex-item" style="max-width: 70%">
					<p>The objectives of the Control leg of the Architecture mirror those of the AICPA Trust Services Framework:</p>
					<ul>
						<li><u><i>Security</i></u> protects against unauthorized access.</li>
						<li><u><i>Availability</i></u> prevents data loss and system downtime.</li>
						<li><u><i>Processing integrity</i></u> preserves data integrity.</li>
						<li><u><i>Confidentiality</i></u> and <u><i>privacy</i></u> maintain secrets. Because of their similarity, these two occupy the same block in the Architecture.</li>
					</ul>
				</div>
			</div>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h3>Security</h3>
			<blockquote>The system is protected against unauthorized access, use or modification.</blockquote>
			<p>Access controls are the primary security tool. They promote system security in one of three ways:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><u><i>Permissions</i></u> determine authorization.</li>
				<li><u><i>Authentication</i></u> allows authorized users to identify themselves.</li>
				<li><u><i>Hardening</i></u> prevents unauthorized access.</li>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h3>Database Permissions</h3>
			<p>Permissions determine which users can initiate the four primary storage functions: create, read, update, delete (CRUD). However, these four functions are more relevant to a database system than a file system. Using SQL syntax as an example, the four basic commands are SELECT, INSERT INTO, UPDATE and DELETE. Each maps directly into one of the four storage functions.</p>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h3>File Permissions</h3>
			<p>Permissions in common file systems are less granular. Instead of identifying permissions for four storage functions, file systems focus on three functions: read, write and execute. The overlap between file read and database read is apparent, but the other two file system functions are less similar to database functions. Create, update and delete are all write functions because write permissions award the ability to edit. Execute governs launching applications. This permission has no useful meaning in a database setting.</p>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h3>Folder Permissions</h3>
			<p>File systems comprise both files and folders, and although the same three permissions (read, write and execute) govern both sets of objects, the interpretation differs between files and folders. Read allows the user to see the contents of a folder. Write allows a user to modify the contents of a folder. Execute allows the user to open a folder and interact with its contents.</p>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h3>Me Against the World</h3>
			<p>In addition to three functions (read, write, execute), file permissions have three different levels: user (or owner), group, world (or others). User and world are easy to understand. User is the usually the creator of a file or folder; world is everyone who has no level of ownership. Group is a collection of users that need similar access but frequently less access than the owner. The owner may or may not belong to the group.</p>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h3>Symbolic Notation</h3>
			<p>Unix-like operating systems display file permissions in two different but equivalent ways. One is more readable and one is more concise. Symbolic notation, the more readable format, uses ten characters to explain whether the user, group or world can read (r), write (w) or execute (e). Missing permissions are replaced with a hyphen.</p>

				</div>
			</div>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h3>First Character</h3>
			<p>Symbolic notation uses nine characters (i.e., three triads), but the string contains ten spaces. The first identifies the file type: regular file (-), directory (d), link (l), etc.</p>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h3>Octal Permissions</h3>
			<p>Numeric notation, frequently referred to as octal or octet permissions, uses base-8 notation to report permissions. In this notation, read receives a value of 4, write a value of 2 and execute a value of 1. These are added together to obtain one value per significant digit. Although frequently reported using only three significant digits&mdash;first, user; second, group; third, world&mdash;these permissions actually have a four digit, which we will ignore and always set to 0. Symbolic notation has a corollary to this fourth digit, but because we set it to zero, it will not manifest in symbolic notation.</p>

		<section>
			<h3>Groups vs. Roles</h3>
			<p>Unix groups are faceted, and in many Unix-like operating systems, the user is automatically assigned to multiple groups. These groups frequently have no useful interpretation outside of the system because they are designed to assign control of software and hardware (e.g., storage, lp, optical, power). It is possible to create additional groups for business purposes.</p>
			<p>In a business sense, groups may have multiple interpretations. Two examples would be roles and departments. Because individuals in the same role should have the same access and because individuals' access should change if they switch roles, it is most appropriate to assign permissions by role and not user.</p>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h3>Groups vs. Departments</h3>
			<p>A group may also be thought of as a department (i.e., a collection of roles). These individuals would not need the same access, but they may all need some access to everything created within the department. This definition of group is more in line with the meaning in a Unix system. In fact, the default Unix permissions are not well-equipped for role-based access, especially since the owner of a file is likely the creator, not a role.</p>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h3>Global Directories</h3>
			<p>Because role-based permissions are more useful in centralized storage solutions, it is useful to have the access controls in a central location. Directories can store user information, user roles and role-based permissions. Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) is the open standard for these directories, although some operating systems rely on closed solutions (e.g., Active Directory for Windows Server). In this scenario, it is possible again to control four (CRUD), instead of three (RWX) storage functions.</p>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h3>Segregation of Duties</h3>
			<p>One important consideration for accountants is segregations of duties, which dictates that stewardship of assets should not accompany record-keeping. For examaple, any role responsible for counting cash, storing inventory or paying bills should not be able to change the accounting records for cash, receivables, payables or inventory. The implication is clear. If hold an asset and can change the records, I can steal and cover it up.</p>

			<h3>One User to Rule Them All</h3>
			<p>In any system, everything must be owned by some user. Most users only own some content in order to avoid unintended, unauthorized access. However, one user (i.e., root or superuser) owns the entire system. The root user is the owner of system files, and the root user has full access to all files from any other user. Popular database systems also employ a root user who has all privileges and can grant those privileges to other users.</p>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h3>Elevated Permissions</h3>
			<p>Because the root user owns system files, a normal user must obtain elevated permissions to alter the system. In Unix systems this is done by changing to the superuser (su) or by becoming fakeroot (sudo). This becomes even more complicated if one user should access an application that should access other resources because the number of relevant permissions can become overwhelming.</p>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h3>Just Say No</h3>
			<p>Because it is easier to avoid incompatibilities with permissions, some users succumb to the temptation to use the root user for everything. This is a worst-case scenario for security and should never be done. Instead, learn to navigate permissions.</p>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h3>Authentication</h3>
			<p>Permissions determine what an authorized user may do; authentication allows authorized users to identify themselves. Authentication has three forms:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Something the user knows: password or passphrase.</li>
				<li>Something the user has: badge, key card or code generator.</li>
				<li>Something about the user: biometrics.</li>
			</ul>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h3>Multifactor Authentication</h3>
			<p>Security and convenience are always trade-offs. Anything that is more difficult for unauthorized users to access is also more difficult for authorized users to access. However, in many situations, the cost of added inconvenience is well worth avoiding exposure. In the current climate, one form of authentication is rarely enough to avoid problems. Passwords can be comprised through guessing, brute force or social engineering; key cards go missing; face or voice recognition can be faked. A combination of these is better (e.g., a password and a time-based code or a key card and a hand print).</p>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h3>Remote Authentication</h3>
			<p>Just as an LDAP server can store permissions, it can also store credentials. This is handy for allowing users to identify themselves on multiple machines on the same network, but in order for it to work, the user must already be in the network (LAN). Remote Authentication Dial-in User Service (RADIUS) allows users outside of the network (WAN) to authenticate themselves to access LAN resources. RADIUS is often used in virtual private network (VPN) and wireless local area network (WLAN) access.</p>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h3>Hardening</h3>
			<p>Hardening reduces a system's surface of vulnerability. Firewalls and network traffic monitors are popular hardening tools because these restrict access to network devices. Additionally, hardening involves removing old authentication credentials and disabling unnecessary services (i.e., daemons) and closing their respective ports.</p>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h3>Firewalls</h3>
			<p>Because it is possible to use authentication protocols to access a LAN from the WAN, it can also be possible to gain unauthorized access from the WAN. Firewalls, or more generally packet filters, restrict network traffic to and from certain network ports on certain devices. Firewalls are like Dementors in that they cannot distinguish between authorized and unauthorized traffic.</p>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h3>What Day is It?</h3>
			<p>In the context of software development, hardening involves apply patches to exploits. Although it is best to write the software correctly the first time, exploits arise because developers cut corners or make mistakes. They also arise because people invent new ways to exploit software. A zero-day exploit is a software exploit that is found before the developers know about, and this is an increasingly frequent occurrence.</p>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h3>What Can Exploits Do?</h3>
			<p>One problem with software exploits is that frequently result in the user gaining elevated privileges or accessing unauthorized content. This is how iOS devices are jailbroken or Android devices rooted.</p>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h3>Availability</h3>
			<blockquote>The system is available for operation and use as committed or agreed.</blockquote>
			<p>Two threats of availability are data loss and downtime. Three tools combat these threats:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><u><i>Interpretation</i></u> preserves accessibility of legacy data.</li>
				<li><u><i>Redundancy</i></u> avoids data loss and unplanned downtime.</li>
				<li><u><i>Change management</i></u> limits planned downtime.</li>
			</ul>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h3>Interpretation</h3>
			<p>I cannot say what the original reason was for the Unix philosophy that the basis of all data is plan text, but a significant benefit of that mindset is a maximization of data accessibility. Binary files require specific hardware and software to access, so users have two choices (1) retain in perpetuity the hardware and software necessary to access the data or (2) emulate the hardware and software.</p>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h3>Emulation</h3>
			<p>Similar to virtualization, emulation uses software to mimic hardware. However, in the case of emulation, the hardware is non-existent, and software translates hardware requests into the proper architecture and communicates with the actual hardware. (Incidentally, this is a popular practice for playing old console and arcade games on personal computers.)</p>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h3>Redundancy</h3>
			<p>System components can fail. A single point of failure is a failure that stops an entire system, and redundancy is designed to avoid this phenomenon. A duplicate site creates redundancy for an entire cloud. A server cluster, in addition to increasing availability by adding computing power to support multiple simultaneous client requests, allows alternative servers to take over when one server fails. Storage backups create duplicates of data in case storage devices become corrupted.</p>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h3>Full Backups</h3>
			<p>Full backups create a copy of all current data. The benefit of full backups are that only one restoration is necessary to bring the system back to the most recent backup. The drawback is that full backups are large. They store everything, which means that each object that existed prior to a backup is stored in every subsequent backup, as well.</p>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h3>Incremental Backups</h3>
			<p>Incremental backups only store the changes (deltas) since the previous backup. This is the backup method used by Git and other version control systems. In order to restore an entire backup, it is necessary to restore every delta. This process can become impossibly long. As a result, many backup solutions combine these two methods by having frequent incremental backups and infrequent full backups.</p>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h3>Denied!</h3>
			<p>One major threat to system availability is denial of service (DoS). This involves sending a small network package (i.e., ping) to a server and asking for a response. If the number of pings becomes too large, this otherwise innocuous communication can overwhelm resources and effectively shutdown a server. Frequently, the attack is distributed across multiple clients in a distributed denial of service (DDoS) attack.</p>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h3>Processing Integrity</h3>
			<blockquote>System processing is complete, valid, accurate, timely and authorized.</blockquote>
			<p>The goal of every information system is to convert raw data into useful information by avoiding errors and corruption:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><u><i>Data validation</i></u> minimizes data entry and processing errors.</li>
				<li><u><i>Transaction processing</i></u> maintains integrity of database records.</li>
				<li><u><i>Refreshing</i></u> ensures that analyzed data is up-to-date.</li>
			</ul>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h3>Data Entry</h3>
			<p>Human intervention can always result in errors. Data validation minimizes the possibility of data entry errors in multiple forms:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><u><i>Data type</i></u> verifies that content has the correct data type.</li>
				<li><u><i>Check digits</i></u> determine that a string of digits follows allowable algorithms (e.g., credit cards, ISBN).</li>
				<li><u><i>Presence check</i></u> looks for missing values in a record.</li>
				<li><u><i>Range check</i></u> confirms that a value is between a predetermined minimum and maximum.</li>
				<li><u><i>Uniqueness check</i></u> ensures that unique values are not duplicated (e.g., usernames).</li>
				<li><u><i>Look-up check</i></u> limits selection to pre-existing values (e.g., approved vendors).</li>
			</ul>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h3>Data Processing</h3>
			<p>Data validation also minimizes errors in data processing. A common example is the batch or hash total, which looks for missing records when processing a group (or batch) of records by comparing a value for the group to the aggregation of individual values (e.g., total hours worked compared with the sum of hours worked in each record).</p>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h3>ACID</h3>
			<p>One of the biggest benefits of RDBMS and drawbacks of NoSQL is transaction processing, which prevents a transaction from only being partially completed. In order for a database to be transactional, it must satisfy ACID:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><u><i>Atomicity</i></u>: all changes happen or none happen.</li>
				<li><u><i>Consistency</i></u>: all actions as a group violate no constraints.</li>
				<li><u><i>Isolation</i></u>: each transaction is treated as occurring before or after, not during, any others.</li>
				<li><u><i>Durability</i></u>: each committed transaction's changes are permanent.</li>
			</ul>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h3>Refreshing</h3>
			<p>In a data warehousing environment, the transaction systems contain one version of the data, and the data warehouse and data marts contain another version. Accurate data analytics relies on current data in the warehouse, which requires periodic refreshing to bring the warehouse copy up to date.</p>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h3>Confidentiality</h3>
			<blockquote>Information designated as confidential is protected as committed or agreed.</blockquote>
			<p>Security and confidentiality both address the need to prevent unauthorized access, so many tools can serve both purposes. However, three tools commonly serve to keep information secret:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><u><i>Encryption</i></u> prevents reading sensitive content, especially in transit.</li>
				<li><u><i>Intermediation</i></u> anonymizes communication.</li>
				<li><u><i>Rights management</i></u> avoids unlicensed use of intellectual property.</li>
			</ul>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h3>Privacy</h3>
			<blockquote>Confidentiality is distinguished from privacy in that privacy deals with personal information whereas, confidentiality refers to a broader range of information that is not restricted to personal information.</blockquote>
			<p>Because of the inherent similarity between confidentiality and privacy, we will assume that similar tools preserve both.</p>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h3>Encryption</h3>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h3>Secure Shell</h3>
			<p>Some popular forms on communication rely on encryption. <u><i>Secure Shell</i></u> (SSH) allows remote access of a single computer using an encrypted connection. This is the current standard for accessing the command line of another computer, although it is also possible to tunnel graphical content through SSH. SSH is commonly considered a secure alternative to telnet, which historically was the standard for communication between two computers.</p>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h3>Virtual Private Network</h3>
			<p>SSH is useful for remotely accessing a single computer with an encrypted connection, but this is not always the desired goal. If an individual wants to access an entire LAN remotely, a <u><i>Virtual Private Network</i></u> (VPN) is necessary. A VPN uses RADIUS authentication to allow a WAN device to join a LAN. Because communication on a LAN should remain private, the connection between the WAN device and the LAN is encrypted. This is not only useful for telework, but also for preserving privacy when using a public WiFi network to access the Internet. As a result, many vendors sell subscription access to VPN servers.</p>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h3>Proxy Servers</h3>
			<p>Sometimes encrypted communication is not sufficient to maintain privacy because it is feasible to identify the source of the communication. Proxy servers redirect traffic and mask the source IP address to add anonymity. This is similar to the functionality of a private VPN, and given the choice, the encryption involved with a VPN makes it superior to a proxy server.</p>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h3>Rights Management</h3>
			<p>Intellectual property licenses dictate approved use of licensed content. Maintenance of rights metadata prevents authorized access and ensures prompt deletion of content with expired licenses. Also, rights management is inherently a required compliance activity when using licensed content.</p>
		</section>
		
		<section>
			<h3>Accounting Tie-in</h3>
			<p>Accounting architects have two perspectives on internal controls. The first comes from their role as architects. From this perspective controls are necessary to avoid the &ldquo;garbage in, garbage out&rdquo; problem. Information is only useful if it is derived from accurate data, and controls protect data integrity. Additionally, architects wish to preserve trade secrets. The second perspective is as accountants. Regulatory compliance dictates proper controls over the financial reporting process to ensure accurate financial statements. This is similar to the &ldquo;garbage in, garbage out&rdquo; principle, but in this case, the beneficiaries of the controls are external stakeholders.</p>
