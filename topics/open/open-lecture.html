			<h3>Proprietary IP</h3>
			<ul>
				<li><u><i>Copyright</i></u> prohibits making, transmitting, displaying, or selling copies or derivatives of a work.</li>
				<li><u><i>Patent</i></u> prohibits making, using, or selling an invention.</li>
				<li><u><i>Trademark</i></u> prohibits use of a name, symbol, figure, letter, word, or mark adopted and used by a manufacturer or merchant.</li>
				<li><u><i>Non-disclosure agreement</i></u> restricts disclosure of information to external parties.</li>
				<li><u><i>Non-compete clause</i></u> prevents use of trade secrets in a competing enterprise.</li>
			</ul>
			<p style="text-align: center">These all restrict use of <i><u>intellectual property</u></i> (IP).</p>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h3>Proprietary Is Licensed</h3>
			<p>The creator of intellectual property automatically has all rights to that creation. As a result, a tool is necessary to award third parties certain rights so that creator retains ownership while letting others benefit from the creation. A <u><i>license</i></u> serves this purpose. It allows the owner of intellectual property to grant privileges to others without giving up ownership.</p>
			<p style="taxt-align: center">(This is the legal text that no one reads but everyone agrees to when installing software, signing up for an online service, etc.)</p>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h3>Proprietary is Closed</h3>
			<p>The idea of a license can be useful in leaving the creator control over a creation while allowing for adoption of the creation. This encourages invention by protecting the inventor. To put it in a business context, companies may not be as willing to invest millions into R&amp;D unless they could protect their investment. Film and record studios reinforce this point when denouncing piracy. However, a side-effect of proprietary licenses is the formation of black boxes. No one can investigate the creation, make changes to it, or share the creation with others. Proprietary licenses create <u><i>closed content</i></u>.</p>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h3>Open is Open</h3>
			<p>The premise of <u><i>open content</i></u> is that the creator of intellectual property make the creation <i>freely available</i>&mdash;we will define <i>free</i> later on&mdash;for others to <u><i>view</i></u>, <u><i>inspect</i></u>, <u><i>modify</i></u>, <u><i>reuse</i></u>, and <u><i>redistribute</i></u>. The Modern Paradigm for Standards identifies the following benefits of open content:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><u><i>Interoperability</i></u>: the ability of a product, system, or practice to work with other products, systems, or practices.</li>
				<li><u><i>Transparency</i></u>: subjection to public scrutiny.</li>
				<li><u><i>Innovation</i></u>: the creation to new ideas.</li>
			</ul>	
		</section>

		<section>
			<h3>Proprietary Was Open Once</h3>
			<p>Innovation is necessary for a society to progress. The ability to create new ideas and inventions encourages competition, which in turn, encourages additional innovation. Interestingly, the United States created the Patent Office so that inventors would publish the specifications of their inventions to promote innovation. Unfortunately, patents now serve the exact opposite purpose, and patent holders sue whenever someone has a similar creation. This discourages competition, innovation, and improvement, and society suffers as a result.</p>

			<h3>A Case for Openness</h3>

			<a href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/71/PhD_Comics_Open_Access_Week_2012.ogv">Open Access Proposal</a>
			<p>(The setting of this video is academic research, but the basic premise&mdash;the pitfalls of using proprietary licensing to restrict access to resources&mdash;applies to many settings. This context of this video is one example.)</p>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h3>Creative Commons</h3>
			<p>Creative Commons licenses (CC) allow individuals to make creative works (e.g., music, videos, research) freely available with a combination of the following conditions:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><u><i>Attribution</i></u> (BY) requires giving the creator credit.</li>
				<li><u><i>Share-alike</i></u> (SA) restricts the license of derivative works to be the same as the original.</li>
				<li><u><i>Non-commercial</i></u> (NC) prevents the use of the work for commercial purposes (i.e., for profit).</li>
				<li><u><i>No Derivative Works</i></u> (ND) allows only verbatim copies.</li>
			</ul>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h3>Many Types of Closed and Open</h3>
			<ul>
				<li><u><i>Access</i></u>: the availability of creative works.</li>
				<li><u><i>Standard</i></u>: a set of specifications.</li>
				<li><u><i>Format</i></u>: a standard for storage of digital media.</li>
				<li><u><i>System</i></u>: interconnected hardware and software components.</li>
				<li><u><i>Design</i></u>: hardware or software schematics.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>These words clearly have alternative definitions in other settings, but the definitions listed apply in the context of a discussion on open content. Each term comprises both closed and open content (e.g., some standards are closed standards and others are open standards).</p>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h3>Gratis versus Libre</h3>
			<p>Freely available generally means free as in freedom (libre: with little or no restriction) <em>not</em> as in beer (gratis: for zero price). These freedoms allow for inspection, modification, reuse, redistribution, etc. Although the creators of open content frequently also make their creations available at no cost, this is not a requirement in order for the content to qualify as open. (Open access is an exception to this because it requires no-cost access.)</p>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h3>(Really) Hidden Benefits</h3>
			<p>It is difficult to explain the benefit of open standards and formats. One reason for this is that the end-user is seemingly shielded from the costs of using closed standards and formats. A perfect example of this is MP3, a closed file format for audio. It is the most widely adopted file format for audio, and as a result, it seems highly interoperable, meaning that many devices can play MP3 files. However, every time Apple produces an iPhone that can play MP3 files, it must pay a licensing fee because the owner of the MP3 format requires a royalty in return for the ability to play audio files with that format. That cost is then surreptitiously passed to the customer in the form of higher prices, but since the customers want an iPhone anyway, who cares, right?</p>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h3>More Obvious Benefit</h3>
			<p>Perhaps this example will convince a few of you. That same iPhone uses a Lightning connector, which is a closed standard. If a customer wants a replacement cable, the two choices are to pay Apple's prices for a new cable or to purchase a third-party replica. However, that third party paid Apple a royalty in order to be able to produce cables compliant with that closed standard, and the manufacturer certainly passed those costs on to the customer.</p>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h3>Apple Again</h3>
			<p>Apple is a veritable treasure trove of examples of closed content. Unlike PCs, Macs are closed systems, meaning that the combination of hardware and software is restricted. Some end-users like the closed-system model because they believe that it &ldquo;just works,&rdquo; but one of the costs is the requirement to purchase Apple hardware in order to use OS X. Anyone who has ever looked at the price tag for a Mac knows the implications of this requirement. (Oh, and the same closed system applies to the iPhone, as well: no iOS without the iPhone hardware.)</p>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h3>A Much Bigger Example</h3>
			<p>These examples explain some of the drawbacks of closed formats and standards. On the other hand, we all benefit immensely from one particular open standard: the World Wide Web. (As an aside, the Internet is a combination of networks that allows for communication around the world; the World Wide Web is the content that we access via the Internet.) Because the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) leaves this standard open, anyone can add and access content royalty-free.</p>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h3>Open Source</h3>
			<p>Although these examples demonstrate the value of open access, open standards, open formats, and open systems, in this course, we will primarily focus on open design&mdash;hardware schematics and software code&mdash;and its most important component: open source software.</p>

		<section>
			<h3>Software Explained</h3>
			<p>In order to understand the significance of open source software, it is necessary to understand what software is. Software is nothing more than words written as commands in a collection of text files. These words constitute the software's &ldquo;source code.&rdquo; Before distributing copies of proprietary software, the developers convert the words into &ldquo;microcode&rdquo; which the computer can understand and execute but is not human-readable. This prevents end-users from viewing and modifying the software.</p>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h3>In the Beginning</h3>
			<p style="text-align: center">(1950s to be exact...)</p>
			<p>Developers shared software code freely. This may have been, in part, the result of software being developed for a single type of computer, so no application could achieve wide adoption.</p>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h3>Then Came the Software License</h3>
			<p style="text-align: center">(Turn the clock forward to 1970...)</p>
			<p>Developers began to write more complicated programs that could run on multiple different types of computers, similarly to the circumstances of today. As a result, developers wanted to receive compensation for their effort and stopped sharing code.</p>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h3>All Fun and Games Until Someone Gets Hurt</h3>
			<p>In 1979, Richard Stallman worked for MIT, and his department had a Xerox laser printer that would jam. The programmers in the department could have created a program that would have the printer report a jam, but they had no access to the printer's source code. One academic had received a copy of the printer's source code from Xerox but was under a non-disclosure agreement not to share it.</p>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h3>And Man Created the Free Software Movement</h3>
			<p>In order to combat the power of software vendors and recreate the earlier environment of shared software, Richard Stallman established the Free Software Foundation (FSF) to support the development of software in which the source code was freely shared.</p> 
		</section>

		<section>
			<h3>Four Freedoms</h3>
			<p>Richard Stallman identified four essential freedoms:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>The freedom to run the program as you wish, for any purpose (freedom 0)</li>
				<li>The freedom to study how the program works, and change it so it does your computing as you wish (freedom 1)</li>
				<li>The freedom to redistribute copies so you can help your neighbor (freedom 2)</li>
				<li>The freedom to distribute copies of your modified versions to others (freedom 3)</li>
			</ul>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h3>Thought Experiment</h3>
			<p>Based on the FSF four freedoms, which combination(s) of CC conditions result in a free license?</p>
			<div class="flex-row top">
				<div class="flex-item" style="max-width: 50%">
					<ul>
						<li>Run the program as you wish, for any purpose.</li>
						<li>Study how the program works, and change it so it does our computing as you wish.</li>
						<li>Redistribute copies so you can help your neighbor.</li>
						<li>Distribute copies of your modified versions to others.</li>
					</ul>
				</div>
				<div class="flex-item" style="max-width: 50%">
					<ul>
						<li>Attribution (BY) requires giving the creator credit.</li>
						<li>Share-alike (SA) restricts the license of derivative works to be the same as the original.</li>
						<li>Non-commercial (NC) prevents the use of the work for commercial purposes.</li>
						<li>No Derivative Works (ND) allows only verbatim copies.</li>
					</ul>
				</div>
			</div>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h3>Still a License</h3>
			<p>In 1989, Richard Stallman introduced the GNU General Public License (GPL) for releasing open source software. It may seem odd that an opponent of proprietary software licenses should choose to introduce a software license of his own. However, it turns out that this action makes sense. In the absence of a license, the creator's only option is to disallow any third-party use or to place the creation in the public domain and give up all rights to the creation. The open source license allows the creator to retain rights while simultaneously leaving the creation freely available. Since that time, additional groups have released alternative open source licenses each with a different interpretation of what constitutes &ldquo;free.&rdquo;</p>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h3>Prominent Open Source Software Projects</h3>
			<ul>
				<li>Mozilla Firefox (web browser)</li>
				<li>Android (mobile operating system)</li>
				<li>Linux (operating system)</li>
				<li>Apache Hadoop (data analysis tool)</li>
				<li>MySQL (database)</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Take some time searching online to see whether other applications you use are open source.</p>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h3>Another Case for Openness</h3>
			<p>No one person is so good at creating that additional help would not be beneficial. That is why we like to work in groups. Open source allows the size of the group that can contribute to a software project to be bigger than ever through crowdsourcing.</p>
			<blockquote>Crowdsourcing: the practice of obtaining needed services, ideas, or content by soliciting contributions from a large group of people and especially from the online community rather than from traditional employees or suppliers.<br>&ndash; Merriam-Webster</blockquote>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h3>Accounting Tie-in</h3>
			<p>Accountants are less accustomed to open content. US GAAP, GAAS, IFRS, and IRC are not open standards, and the work product of accountants is proprietary. The primary tie-in between open content and accountants is embedded in the link between accounting architects and information systems, so an information systems tie-in is more appropriate in this context. Regardless, accountants are all beneficiaries of Open Web and Open Internet for online communication and access to online resources.</p>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h3>Information Systems Tie-in</h3>
			<p>Open access is less directly applicable to the setting of a corporate information system, and open hardware is little more than an idea at this point. Open source software, on the other hand, is a prominent force in information systems. 98% of firms use open source software in their information systems. Together with open source software, open standards and open formats allow for interoperability between information systems and for free adoption of best practices.</p>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h3>IT Knowledge</h3>
			<p>No profession has not benefited from access to the Internet and the World Wide Web. One of the primary drivers for this benefit is the availability of open access content on the Web. This is distinct from the Open Web and Open Internet movements. These movements may allow users to visit sites, but without open access content, we would need to pay for everything we want to see at those sites. Thanks to creators willing to share their creative work, we can read blogs, news articles, reviews, and how-tos, watch tutorials, listen to podcasts, etc. This is more than simply a convenience. It is a means for learning, and IT professionals rely heavily on online resources to develop and maintain information systems.</p>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h3>Independent Research</h3>
			<p>Accounting architects are no different. Up-to-date knowledge about information system technologies and practices come in large part from open access online materials. During this course, you are all architects-in-training, and you will need to rely on these same materials in your research deliverables: presentations and tech reports. I have intentionally not provided you with all information necessary to complete your research so that you will learn independently.</p>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h3>Final Note</h3>
			<p>In the past, some students have complained that they needed to perform additional Internet research in order to fully understand the topics discussed in this course. This is not an accident. The intent of this course is not to spoon-feed you information. You should need and want to engage in independent study in order to learn and understand, not only for your presentations and memos, but for your personal edification.</p>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h3>Extra Credit Presentations</h3>
			<ol>
				<li>Compare and contrast <i>copycenter</i>, <i>copyleft</i>, and <i>copyfree</i>. Give examples of licenses in each category, and share pros and cons of each type of license.</li>
				<li>Explain the history and purpose of three open source licenses: GNU General Public License (GPL), GNU Lesser General Public License (LGPL), and GNU Affero General Public License (AGPL).</li>
				<li>Introduce the Wikimedia Foundation and its role in open access.</li>
				<li>Can and should businesses use proprietary or open source licenses for the intellectual property they create? In other words, should firms share their intellectual property under an open source license, or should they keep their IP under a proprietary license?</li>
			</ol>
