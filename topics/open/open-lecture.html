		<section>
			<h3>Proprietary is Closed</h3>
			<ul>
				<li><u><i>Copyright</i></u> prohibits making, transmitting, displaying, or selling copies or derivatives of a work.</li>
				<li><u><i>Patent</i></u> prohibits making, using, or selling an invention.</li>
				<li><u><i>Trademark</i></u> prohibits use of a name, symbol, figure, letter, word, or mark adopted and used by a manufacturer or merchant.</li>
				<li><u><i>Non-disclosure agreement</i></u> restricts disclosure of information to external parties.</li>
				<li><u><i>Non-compete clause</i></u> prevents use of trade secrets in a competing enterprise.</li>
			</ul>
			<p style="text-align: center">These all restrict use of <i><u>intellectual property</u></i>.</p>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h3>Many Types of Openness&mdash;One Theme</h3>
			<ul>
				<li>Open Standard</li>
				<li>Open Design</li>
				<li>Open System</li>
				<li>Open Access</li>
			</ul>
			<p>All of these have one thing in common: <i><u>crowdsourcing</u></i>.</p>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h3>What is Crowdsourcing?</h3>
			<blockquote>The practice of obtaining needed services, ideas, or content by soliciting contributions from a large group of people and especially from the online community rather than from traditional employees or suppliers.<br>&ndash; Merriam-Webster</blockquote>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h3>Open Standard</h3>
			<p>A standard is a set of specifications. Although no common definition of <i>open standard</i> exists, the Modern Paradigm for Standards lists a number of characteristics of open standards:
			<ol>
				<li>Cooperation between standards organizations</li>
				<li>Adherence to fundamental principles of standards development: due process, broad <u>consensus</u>, transparency, balance, openness</li>
				<li>Collective empowerment that promotes <u>interoperability</u>, scalability, stability, <u>competition</u> and <u>innovation</u></li>
				<li>Availability</li>
				<li>Voluntary Adoption</li>
			</ol>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h3>Standards Bodies</h3>
			<ul>
				<li>World Standards Cooperation (WSC) comprising International Organization for Standardization (ISO), International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC) and International Telecommunication Union (ITU)</li>
				<li>World Wide Web Consortium (W3C)</li>
				<li>Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE)</li>
				<li>Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF)</li>
			</ul>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h3>Prominent Open Standards</h3>
			<ul>
				<li>World Wide Web (W3C)</li>
				<li>Internet protocol suite (IETF)</li>
				<li>Universal Serial Bus (USB-IF)</li>
				<li>Wireless Fidelity (IEEE)</li>
				<li>Synchronous dynamic random-access memory (JEDEC)</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Remember, not all widely adopted standards are open.</p>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h3>Net Neutrality</h3>
			<p>The World Wide Web relies on many open standards to supply the content that we access through the Internet. The Open Web movement promotes the continuation of open web technologies. The Open Internet movement, on the other hand, promotes open access to web content by removing the power of Internet Service Providers (ISPs) to restrict access to sites. Because this movement would ensure that all content be treated equally, it is also referred to as &ldquo;net neutrality.&rdquo;</p>
			<p style="text-align: center">What is your opinion? Should the Internet be open?</p>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h3>Open Formats</h3>
			<p>File formats are standards for the storage of digital media. Open formats rely on open standards. Popular open file formats include:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Images: JPEG 2000</li>
				<li>Audio: Ogg, FLAC</li>
				<li>Video: Matroska (MKV)</li>
				<li>Text: Plain text, HTML, ePub, Office Open XML, OpenDocument, CSV, XML</li>
				<li>Other: iCalendar, WebDAV</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Here again, not all popular formats are open. For example, MP3 and MP4 are extremely popular formats for music and video, respectively. However, these are not open formats.</p>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h3>Open Design</h3>
			<ul>
				<li><u><i>Free and open-source software</i></u> allows free access to, modification of, and redistribution of source code.</li>
				<li><u><i>Open-source hardware</i></u> has open schematics and drivers.</li>
			</ul>

		<section>
			<h3>In the Beginning</h3>
			<p style="text-align: center">(1950s to be exact...)</p>
			<p>Developers shared software code for free without copyright. This may have been in part the result of software being developed for a single hardware architecture, so no application could achieve wide adoption. One popular software development focus was time-sharing applications, which allowed multiple users to use the same computer hardware at the same time.</p>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h3>Then Came the Software License</h3>
			<p style="text-align: center">(Turn the clock forward to 1970...)</p>
			<p>Developers transitioned from assembly code (low-level code that was closely tied to machine architecture) to higher-level, architecture-independent code that resulted in more complicated programs. As a result, developers wanted to receive compensation for their effort. Unix, a new, portable operating system, was an early example of software that required the purchase of a license.</p>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h3>What Is a License?</h3>
			<p>A <u><i>license</i></u> allows the owner of intellectual property to grant use to others without giving up ownership.</p>
			<p>What are some common examples of licensing that we encounter?</p>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h3>All Fun and Games Until Someone Gets Hurt</h3>
			<p>In 1979, Richard Stallman worked for MIT, and his department had a Xerox laser printer that would jam. The programmers in the department could have created a program that would have the printer report a jam, but they had no access to the printer's source code, and anyone who had received a copy was under a non-disclosure agreement not to share it.</p>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h3>And Man Created the Free Software Movement</h3>
			<p>In order to combat the power of software vendors and recreate the earlier environment of shared software, Richard Stallman set out to create a free Unix-compatible operating system called GNU. In 1985, he established the Free Software Foundation (FSF) to support the development of free software, and in 1989, he released the GNU General Public License (GPL) for releasing free software.</p> 
		</section>

		<section>
			<h3>Four Freedoms</h3>
			<p>A program is <i><u>free software</u></i> if the program's users have four essential freedoms:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>The freedom to run the program as you wish, for any purpose (freedom 0)</li>
				<li>The freedom to study how the program works, and change it so it does your computing as you wish (freedom 1)</li>
				<li>The freedom to redistribute copies so you can help your neighbor (freedom 2)</li>
				<li>The freedom to distribute copies of your modified versions to others (freedom 3)</li>
			</ul>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h3>Still a License</h3>
			<p>It may seem odd that an opponent of proprietary software licenses should choose to introduce a software license of his own. Could these two attitudes be reconcilable?</p>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h3>FSF is not Alone</h3>
			<p>Since the inception of the Free Software Foundation, other organizations have joined to promote free software. One prominent example is the Open Source Initiative (OSI). Not all groups agree on the correct approach to free software. For example, OSI believes that Richard Stallman is too extreme. He responded, &ldquo;Open source is a development methodology; free software is a social movement. For the Open Source movement, non-free software is a suboptimal solution. For the Free Software movement, non-free software is a social problem and free software is the solution.&rdquo;</p>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h3>&ldquo;Free&rdquo; or &ldquo;Open Source&rdquo;?</h3>
			<p>Although <u><i>free software</i></u> is the focus of the FSF and <u><i>open source software</i></u> is the focus of the OSI, these terms are frequently used interchangeably or combined into FOSS (free and open source software).</p>
			<p>I remain agnostic regarding any struggle between the free software and open source movements because I cannot perceive a difference in outcomes, but feel free to form your own opinion.</p>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h3>Gratis versus Libre</h3>
			<p>Free software is free as in freedom <em>not</em> as in beer<br>(or lunch, for economists). Free software is frequently also provided at no cost, but this is a by-product, not the goal. In fact, when Richard Stallman completed GNU Emacs, a text editor for his GNU operating system, he sold copies of the software. The copies he distributed satisfied the four freedoms, but the copy was not <i>gratis</i>.</p>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h3>Prominent Open-source Software Licenses</h3>
			<ul>
				<li>GNU General Public License (GPL)</li>
				<li>GNU Lesser General Public License (LGPL)</li>
				<li>GNU Affero General Public License (AGPL)</li>
				<li>BSD License</li>
				<li>MIT License</li>
				<li>Mozilla Public License (MPL)</li>
				<li>Common Development and Distribution License (CDDL)</li>
				<li>Apache License</li>
			</ul>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h3>Prominent Open Source Software Projects</h3>
			<ul>
				<li>Mozilla Firefox (web browser) - Mozilla Public License</li>
				<li>Android (mobile operating system) - Apache License</li>
				<li>Linux (operating system) - GNU General Public License</li>
				<li>Apache Hadoop (data analysis tool) - Apache License</li>
				<li>MySQL (database) - GNU General Public License</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Many projects rely on multiple smaller components that have different licenses, so it is not uncommon for a project to rely on multiple software licenses simultaneously. For example, Firefox actually relies on MPL and GPL.</p>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h3>Philosophy Can Influence Licenses</h3>
			<p>One consequence of differing opinions on what constitutes free software is the restrictiveness of the software license. Restrictiveness captures what rights the license gives to the user, but unlike the notion of proprietary content that reduces user rights and reduces openness, restrictiveness reduces user rights to increase openness. Less restrictive open licenses, therefore, increase user rights and decrease openness. This has significant implications because some freedoms as defined by less restrictive licenses are incompatible with more restrictive licenses. This prevents the inclusion of some software code in larger collections.</p>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h3>Open-source Hardware Licenses</h3>
			<p>Open source hardware projects frequently co-opt open-source software licenses for their output. Unfortunately, open-source software licenses are not a great fit for hardware projects because these licenses address copyright and not patents. As a result, a few groups have developed hardware-specific open licenses:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>TAPR Open Hardware License</li>
				<li>CERN Open Hardware License</li>
			</ul>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h3>Open System</h3>
			<ul>
				<li><u><i>Interoperability</i></u> allows third parties to develop compatible software or peripherals.</li>
				<li><u><i>Portability</i></u> allows the system to run on multiple hardware architectures.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Because of the interchangeability of parts in a traditional desktop computer, it may be tempting to conclude that towers constitute open hardware. However, open systems can contain closed components, and it would be more appropriate to refer to these desktops as open systems. Microsoft Windows is another example. What characteristics make this proprietary software an open system?</p>

			<h3>Open Access</h3>

		</section>

		<section>
			<h3>Open Access Licenses</h3>
			<p>Open access can apply to any knowledge base or creative work, not simply academic research, but these licenses are generally not intended for software. (Incidentally, the materials for this course are made available under Creative Commons.)</p>
			<p><u><i>Creative Commons License</i></u> (CC) with a combination of the following conditions:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><u><i>Attribution</i></u> (BY) requires giving the creator credit.</li>
				<li><u><i>Share-alike</i></u> (SA) restricts the license of derivative works to be the same as the original.</li>
				<li><u><i>Non-commercial</i></u> (NC) prevents the use of the work for commercial purposes.</li>
				<li><u><i>No Derivative Works</i></u> (ND) allows only verbatim copies.</li>
			</ul>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h3>Thought Experiment</h3>
			<p>Based on the FSF four freedoms, which combination(s) of CC conditions result in a free license?</p>
			<div class="flex-row top">
				<div class="flex-item" style="max-width: 50%">
					<ul>
						<li>Run the program as you wish, for any purpose.</li>
						<li>Study how the program works, and change it so it does our computing as you wish.</li>
						<li>Redistribute copies so you can help your neighbor.</li>
						<li>Distribute copies of your modified versions to others.</li>
					</ul>
				</div>
				<div class="flex-item" style="max-width: 50%">
					<ul>
						<li>Attribution (BY) requires giving the creator credit.</li>
						<li>Share-alike (SA) restricts the license of derivative works to be the same as the original.</li>
						<li>Non-commercial (NC) prevents the use of the work for commercial purposes.</li>
						<li>No Derivative Works (ND) allows only verbatim copies.</li>
					</ul>
				</div>

			<h3>Gratis versus Libre, Again</h3>
			<p>With open access the goal is to provide content at no cost. In this case, <i>gratis</i> and <i>libre</i> both mean free as in beer.</p>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h3>Accounting Tie-in</h3>
			<p>Accountants are less accustomed to open content. US GAAP, GAAS, IFRS, and IRC are not open standards, and the work product of accountants is proprietary. The primary tie-in between open content and accountants is embedded in the link between accounting architects and information systems, so an information systems tie-in is more appropriate in this context. Regardless, accountants are all beneficiaries of Open Web and Open Internet for online communication and access to online resources.</p>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h3>Information Systems Tie-in</h3>
			<p>Open access is less directly applicable to the setting of a corporate information system, and open hardware is little more than an idea at this point. Open source software, on the other hand, is a prominent force in information systems. 98% of firms use open source software in their information systems. Together with open source software, open standards and open formats allow for interoperability between information systems and for free adoption of best practices.</p>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h3>IT Knowledge</h3>
			<p>No profession has not benefited from access to the Internet and the World Wide Web. One of the primary drivers for this benefit is the availability of open access content on the Web. This is distinct from the Open Web and Open Internet movements. These movements may allow users to visit sites, but without open access content, we would need to pay for everything we want to see at those sites. Thanks to creators willing to share their creative work, we can read blogs, news articles, reviews, and how-tos, watch tutorials, listen to podcasts, etc. This is more than simply a convenience. It is a means for learning, and IT professionals rely heavily on online resources to develop and maintain information systems.</p>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h3>Independent Research</h3>
			<p>Accounting architects are no different. Up-to-date knowledge about information system technologies and practices come in large part from open access online materials. During this course, you are all architects-in-training, and you will need to rely on these same materials in your research deliverables: presentations and tech reports. I have intentionally not provided you with all information necessary to complete your research so that you will learn independently.</p>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h3>Final Note</h3>
			<p>In the past, some students have complained that they needed to perform additional Internet research in order to fully understand the topics discussed in this course. This is not an accident. The intent of this course is not to spoon-feed you information. You should need and want to engage in independent study in order to learn and understand, not only for your presentations and memos, but for your personal edification.</p>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h3>Extra Credit Presentations</h3>
			<ol>
				<li>Compare and contrast <i>copycenter</i>, <i>copyleft</i>, and <i>copyfree</i>. Give examples of licenses in each category, and share pros and cons of each type of license.</li>
				<li>Explain the history and purpose of three open source licenses: GNU General Public License (GPL), GNU Lesser General Public License (LGPL), and GNU Affero General Public License (AGPL).</li>
				<li>Introduce the Wikimedia Foundation and its role in open access.</li>
				<li>Can and should businesses use proprietary or open source licenses for the intellectual property they create? In other words, should firms share their intellectual property under an open source license, or should they keep their IP under a proprietary license?</li>
			</ol>
