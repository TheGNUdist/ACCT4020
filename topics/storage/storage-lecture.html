			<h3>Accounting Architecture</h3>
			<div class="flex-row">
				<div class="flex-item override"><img src="../../images/Arch5Color.png" alt="AA Arch" style="max-width: 300px"/></div>
				<div class="flex-item" style="max-width: 65%">
					<p>Storage is a unique block in the Technology leg of the Architecture. It is not independent of the Hardware and Software blocks because digital storage comprises a combination of hardware and software components. Also, unlike the other blocks of the Architecture, the Storage block maps directly into a step of the Information Life Cycle: Storage.</p>
				</div>
			</div>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h3>Types of Storage</h3>
			<ul>
				<li><u><i>File systems</i></u> contain data in separate files and folders. This is the traditional storage format we use in our individual computers.</li>
				<li><u><i>Database systems</i></u> store all data in a single location.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>These two systems serve can accommodate physical and digital resources. However, for our purposes, we will exclusively focus on digital storage systems.</p>
		</section>
		
		<section>
			<h3>File or Flat-File?</h3>
			<p>Some texts refer to file systems as &ldquo;flat-file&rdquo; systems because they contain flat files. Flat files are files that are completely read in to memory before use. Most of the files that we use are flat files (e.g., Office documents, PDFs, images, etc), but the term flat-file system is a misnomer. In truth, flat files can belong to either file systems or database systems. One popular example of this is Microsoft Access. Access is a database system because the data in the entire database is in one location, but an Access database is a flat file.</p>
			<p>This is not the most important point about file systems, but it is worthwhile to understand the distinction between file systems and flat files.</p>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h3>How Storage Looks</h3>
			<p>Because storage is a combination of hardware and software, storage contents can appear differently under different circumstances. These different views or schemata (plural of schema) are not different storage methods, but rather distinct representations of the same data.</p>
			<ul>
				<li><u><i>Physical view</i></u>: how the data is stored on physical disks. For the most part, this view is too technical for our purposes.</li>
				<li><u><i>Logical view</i></u>: how the file or database system presents the data. This view applies to system administrators.</li>
				<li><u><i>User view</i></u>: how the end-user application presents the data. This view applies to end users.</li>
			</ul>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h3>A Simple Example</h3>
			<p>A single audio file on a personal computer represents a simple example of the three storage views. The audio file is broken into small blocks of data stored on the physical drive; the operating systems file system shows those blocks as a single logical file within a hierarchical system of folders (or directories, for those from the old school); a music player application uses the data in the file to send music to the user via the audio daemon and the metadata to display information about the track, such as name, artist, album, year, etc.</p>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h3>A Logical Rabbit Hole</h3>
			<p>It is relatively straightforward to understand that the same data can have multiple different user views. Depending on compliance and business need, different end users will see different contents. For example, students can see their own grades, but professors can see the grades of every student. Similarly, multiple logical views of data exist, but their characteristics and distinctions are more technical and more difficult to comprehend.</p>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h3>File Partition</h3>
			<p>When implementing any storage solution, a first consideration is the file system <u><i>partition</i></u>. This determines how the data is stored on <u><i>volumes</i></u>. Different operating systems support different partition formats (NTFS for Windows, HFS+ for OS X, EXT4 for Linux, ZFS for BSD). The differences between these is too technical for our purposes, but many consider ZFS to be the <i>most awesome</i>. A <u><i>partition table</i></u> lists and describes the disk partitions and is necessary in order to add partitions to a disk.</p>
		</section>
			
		<section>
			<h3>Files and Folders</h3>
			<p>The file partition also provides the logical hierarchical folder structure, so that any computer that reads the physical drive can interpret the same set of logical files and folders. (Think of storing files and folders on a USB drive and then reading that drive from another computer. The second computer recognizes the same file/folder structure even if it uses a different operating system.)</p>
		</section>
		
		<section>
			<h3>Volumes</h3>
			<p>File partitions write data to volumes which may be either physical or logical. Physical volumes are physical disks; logical volumes are 

		<section>
			<h3>RAID</h3>
			<p>The physical view of storage is the data as stored on the physical media. The logical view is the data as software portrays it. Redundant Array of Independent Disks (RAID) is one example of a logical data view. RAID allows a system to use discrete physical drives as unified storage. The file partition then sits on top of the RAID.</p>
			<p>RAID can take on many forms, and each setup has a number. RAID 0 involves combining two drives into one <em>stripe</em> allowing the user to interact with a single drive.</p>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h3>Hardware-level RAID Controllers</h3>
			<p>Three different devices can create a RAID. A hardware RAID uses specialized hardware to control the RAID and the underlying disks. This is the most sophisticated, most expensive and rarest form of RAID. The next level down is the motherboard RAID. In this scenario, the motherboard acts as RAID hardware and controls the RAID. Because this only simulates a hardware RAID, users frequently refer to this as fake RAID, and many individuals feel that this form of RAID is too unreliable to be a safe option.</p>
		</section>
		
		<section>
		  <h3>Software-level RAID Controllers</h3>
		  <p>In two prior cases, any operating system on the hardware will only see the RAID and not the drives. The simplest form of RAID, as well as the most popular, is the software RAID. Here, the operating system sees the drives and creates and manages the RAID. This is a popular RAID solution for workstations because it is cheaper than a hardware RAID and more reliable than a fake RAID, but it has one glaring problem. The computer can only have one operating system at a time.</p>
		</section>
		
		<section>
		  <h3>Dual Booting</h3>
		  <p>In addition to virtualizing one operating system within another, it is possible to install multiple operating systems on different partitions or even different drives on the same computer and select one of the operating systems at boot. This is called <u><i>dual booting</i></u> because it usually involves two operating systems. More than two is possible (e.g., triple booting), but that is much more rare. This is not a mission-critical, but rather a hobby, activity because virtualization is almost always sufficient for everything except gaming.</p>
		</section>

		<section>
		  <h3>Logical Volume Management</h3>
			<p>Another form of logical storage is <u><i>Logical Volume Management</i></u> (LVM). Physical volumes are made up of individual <u><i>extents</i></u>, which are very small blocks of data. Physical partitions group these extents together into one group, but LVM can create logical volumes&mdash;different from logical partitions&mdash;that can pull physical extents from any volume in the volume group. This allows logical partitions to stripe, grow and shrink as needed, whereas physical partitions have a static size.</p>

		<section>
			<h3>Two Types of Models</h3>
			<ul>
				<li><u><i>Activity models</i></u> describe a series of processes that comprise a system. This system may be a computer program or a business cycle involving many programs and people.</li>
				<li><u><i>Structure models</i></u> describe the characteristics of people, assets and data and their relationships with one another.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Previously we used activity models to diagram business processes. In this lecture, we will investigate structure diagrams (or data structure diagrams) as a tool for modeling data and databases.</p>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h3>Why More Diagrams?</h3>
			<p>Once we know how to diagram business activities, why is it necessary to create <i>another</i> diagram about the objects in those activities?</p>
			<p>A process diagram identifies players (agents, processes and data objects) in a system, but an information system needs more dimensionality for two reasons. First, without characteristics, each activity would have duplicate objects because no traits would distinguish each instance of an object. Second, employees cannot interact with the black box that a trait-less object would represent. For example, no one can fill a customer order if the only available information is that a customer order exists.</p>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h3>Characteristics and Metadata</h3>
			<p>The Creation block of the Information section of the architecture addresses data classification using metadata. These metadata are the characteristics of the objects in the structure diagram. Although data storage is a maintenance activity and classification a creation activity, the fact that the data storage must store the metadata is further evidence of the need for a completely designed information system prior to data acquisition. Because structure diagrams include object characteristics, these diagrams help to identify necessary metadata.</p>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h3>Three Schema Concept</h3>
			<p>Storage employs three distinct views or <i>schemata</i> of data depending on the audience. These are not different methods for storing data, but rather three different ways of seeing the data stores.</p>
			<ul>
				<li><u><i>External schema</i></u> or user view presents data in the form of end-user applications and reports.</li>
				<li><u><i>Conceptual schema</i></u> graphically represents data objects, metadata and their relationships. Structure diagrams are graphical representations of the conceptual schema.</li>
				<li><u><i>Internal schema</i></u> or computer view or physical view captures the file structure of the physical storage media.</li>
			</ul>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h3>Benefits of Databases</h3>
			<p>The benefits of database systems are highlighted by their treatment of the four basic functions of storage. By having all data in a central location, any data that is created, updated or deleted will result in an up-to-date copy for users that subsequently need to read the data.</p>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h3>Database Views</h3>
			<p>The difference between logical and physical views is especially important for the discussion of database systems. The central nature of the data in a database system is only on the logical level. The data on the database may span one or multiple physical disks. Additionally, an end-user application can always portray de-centralized files in a file system as a single central pool of data.</p>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h3>Relational and Non-relational Databases</h3>
			<p>Several types of databases exist, but the most widely implemented databases are either relational or non-relational (i.e., NoSQL), but even in this group, relational databases are the most popular. We will primarily focus on relational database models, but we will also consider some characteristics of NoSQL databases.</p>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h3>Components of a Relational Database</h3>
			<div class="table" style="font-size: 20px; border: 3px solid black">

				</div>
			</div>
			<p>Each relational database contains one of more two-dimensional tables, called relations. These tables are similar to spreadsheets found in office software. The individual rows in the relations are called records or tuples. The individual columns are called attributes, and all entries in a column must have the same data type. The intersection of a row and a column is a cell or field; cells hold a single value. These components are all part of the <i>logical view</i> of the database.</p>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h3>Non-relational Databases</h3>
			<p>Generically speaking, any database that is not relational could be considered non-relational, but in practice, non-relational (Not Only SQL; NoSQL) databases are a specific class of databases that abandoned the principles of relational databases in favor of alternative models. Although this class comprises several distinct models, we will focus on two popular examples:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Document store</li>
				<li>Column store</li>
			</ul>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h3>Document Store</h3>
			<p>A document store is a special case of a <i><u>key-value store</u></i>. The key in a key-value store uniquely identifies a record, but unlike the attributes in a relational database, in a key-value store the value is an arbitrary object. In the case of document stores, this object is a text document with metadata attributes and values.
		</section>

		<section>
			<h3>Column Store</h3>
			<p>A column store is likely also a special case of a key-value store, but it may not be very helpful to think about it in that manner. Each column contains a key and a value in the same sense as a metadata attribute and value pair. Additionally, each column has a timestamp. Wide-column stores can combine multiple related columns into rows that approximate a single record in a relational table except that because the attributes and values are paired in each column, each row can have a different selection of attributes.</p>

			<h3>Benefits of NoSQL Databases</h3>
			<ul>
				<li><u><i>Scalability</i></u>: Because of the simplicity of each record in the database, NoSQL databases are designed to store many more records than their relational counterparts.</li>
				<li><u><i>Speed</i></u>: Relational databases require data entry transactions to find the correct table and attribute for each value; NoSQL databases take the data input and simply append it to the end of the store. For example, a relational database might need to find customer name, address, date, inventory number and unit price fields in order to store a new sales order. A column store could simply create a new column for each attribute and combine them into a row. A document store could take the order and place all attributes and values into a single document.</li>
			</ul>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h3>Structure Models for Relational Databases</h3>
			<p>Despite the benefits of non-relational databases&mdash;we will discuss an additional benefit when we cover data manipulation later in the course&mdash;we will limit our discussion of structure models to relational databases. Three common structure models exist:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Entity-Relationship (ER; E-R; ERD) diagrams</li>
				<li>UML class diagrams</li>
				<li>Resource-Entity-Agent (REA) diagrams</li>
			</ul>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h3>Entity-Relationship Diagrams</h3>
			<p>The entity-relationship model initially introduced by Peter Chen in 1976 is the <i>de facto</i> standard for modeling relational databases. As the name indicates, the components of an E-R diagram are <i><u>entities</u></i> and <i><u>relationships</u></i> between entities. Additionally, thorough diagrams also include a series of <i><u>attributes</u></i> for each entity and <i><u>cardinalities</u></i> of the relationships.</p>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h3>Unfortunate Confusion</h3>
			<p>E-R diagrams have three data models: conceptual, logical and physical. Unfortunately, these fail to correspond directly to views in the Three Schema Concept. Both the conceptual and the logical model relate to the conceptual schema, and the physical model relates to the logical view. Furthermore, interpretation of these three terms is not consistent across user. As a result, we will restrict our terminology to the four views we have previously identified.</p>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h3>Entities</h3>
			<p>An <u><i>entity</i></u> is something of importance that needs to be represented in the database. Examples of an entity may be Employee, Invoice, Inventory, Time Stamp, etc. It is important to note that these entities are concepts and not manifestations of concepts. For example, Employee is an entity, but a particular employee, Joe Smith, is an instance of that entity. Entities correspond to tables in the database, whereas instances correspond to records in those tables.
		</section>

		<section>
			<h3>Relationships</h3>
			<p>A <u><i>relationship</i></u> is a link between entities. Because entities are nouns, relationships can be described as verbs of one entity acting on another. Examples of this would be the relationship of Employee and Purchase Requisition. These two entities have a relationship describable as: Employee Creates Purchase Requisition.</p>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h3>E-R Shapes</h3>
			<div class="flex-row">
				<div class="flex-item override">
					<div>E-R Diagram</div>
					<img src="../../images/simple-er.png" alt="Simple E-R Diagram" style="max-height: 200px"/>
				</div>
				<div class="flex-item override">
					<div>Chen Notation</div>
					<img src="../../images/simple-chen-er.png" alt="Simple E-R Diagram with Chen Notation" style="max-height: 200px"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p>The rounded rectangles represent the entities, and the connecting lines signify relationships. Chen notation adds a diamond to allow for explicit labeling of relationships. However, a complete E-R diagram incorporates attributes and cardinalities, as well. In other notations, these labels sit near the relationship line, but I exclude them in my diagrams to avoid clutter.</p>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h3>Attributes</h3>
			<p>An <u><i>attribute</i></u> is any relevant characteristic of an entity. These correspond to the columns in a database table. Common examples might include Name, SSN#, SKU, Customer ZIP, etc.</p>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h3>Cardinalities</h3>
			<p>The magnitude of the potential relationships between an instance of one entity and the instances of another (i.e., between a record of one table and the records of another table) is <u><i>cardinality</i></u>. Cardinalities have three potential values: zero, one and many. Cardinalities also have two bounds: minimum and maximum. For example, if the two entities are Customer and Sale, then a customer is associated with at least (minimum) zero and at most (maximum) many sales, and each sale is associated with at least one customer and at most one customer. When the minimum and maximum cardinalities are equal, then it is only necessary to report one: each sale is associated with exactly one customer.</p>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h3>Coyne Rule of Zero</h3>
			<p>Although this is not a widely accepted rule of cardinalities, I believe that each relationship must have at least one minimum cardinality of zero. The reason for this is that the database can only create one record at a time. If a sale is associated with at least one customer, then the customer record must exist prior to the sale. If however, a customer is associated with at least one sale, as well, then the sale record must exist prior to the creation of the customer. However, they cannot both exist first. As a result, one of the minimum cardinalities must be zero.</p>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h3>Sample Diagram</h3>
			<div class="flex-row">
				<div class="flex-item" style="max-width: 55%">
					<p>The cardinalities are read, as follows: an instance of Entity 1 is associated with at least zero and at most one instance of Entity 3, and an instance of Entity 3 is associated with exactly one instance of Entity 1. An instance of Entity 2 is associated with at least zero and at most many instances of Entity 3, and an instance of Entity 3 is associated with at least one and at most many instances of Entity 2.</p>

					<img src="../../images/sample-er.png" alt="Sample E-R Diagram"/>
				</div>
			</div>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h3>Exceptions to Entities and Attributes</h3>
			<p>Not everything that is important to represent is an entity, and not every relevant characteristic is an attribute. The exceptions to this rule are potential entities and attributes that are combinations of pre-existing attributes. One simple example of this relates to Inventory costs. Unit Cost and Quantity on Hand would be an attribute of the entity Inventory, but Total Cost (= Unit Cost x Quantity on Hand) would not. Another example would be employee supervisors. Supervisors would not be an entity because it would simply be a subset of the Employee entity. These would-be entities and attributes become <i><u>user views</u></i> because they are not stored in the database but can be provided to the user.</p>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h3>Keys</h3>
			<p>A special subset of attributes that uniquely identifies a specific instance of an entity is a <u><i>primary key</i></u>. Each value of a primary key can only occur once per entity. Because these primary keys uniquely identify an instance, they also serve to link entities together to implement relationships. A primary key from one entity is included in another entity as a <u><i>foreign key</i></u> to create a link. For example, Employee might include Employee ID as a primary key, and Sales might include Employee ID as a foreign to identify the employee responsible for the sale.</p>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h3>Composite Keys</h3>
			<p>Sometimes no single attribute uniquely identifies an instance of an entity. For example, neither Semester nor Year nor Course nor Section could be a primary key in a course schedule, but the combination of Semester and Year and Course and Section can. Primary keys that comprise multiple attributes are <u><i>composite keys</i></u>.</p>
		</section>

			<h3>Redundancies</h3>
			<p>The benefits of a database system rely on the avoidance of redundancy. In fact, one of the reasons to transition from a file system to a database system is to avoid redundancies from separate individuals tracking information in separate flat files. However, redundancies can also arise in database systems through the creation of <u><i>functional dependencies</i></u>. These dependencies create problematic anomalies.</p>

			<h3>Partial Dependencies</h3>
			<p>A <u><i>partial dependency</i></u> arises if a non-key attribute depends on only part of a composite key. Again using the example of the course list, the composite key Semester, Year, Course and Section identify a unique record. However, the attribute Course Name exclusively depends on Course, which is only part of the composite key.</p>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h3>Transitive Dependencies</h3>
			<p>A <u><i>transitive dependency</i></u> arises when a non-key attribute (i.e., an attribute that is not a primary key) is dependent on another non-key attribute. For example, the entity Employee might include Employee ID, Employee Name, Department ID and Department Name. Employee ID is the primary key, and the employee's department (Department ID) depends on Employee ID. In other words, the instance of department depends on which employee is referenced. However, Department Name depends on Department ID, which is not a primary key. This is a transitive dependency because Employee ID &rarr; Department ID &rarr; Department Name, which creates a transitive link between Employee ID and Department Name.</p>

			<h3>Create Anomaly</h3>
			<p>The <u><i>create anomaly</i></u> arises when it is not possible to add a record to a table because the new record has no value for the primary key. For example, if the Inventory table with SKU as primary key includes the name, address and contact info for the vendor. The company wishes to add an approved vendor to the vendor list, but the company has not yet ordered from that vendor. It is not possible to add that vendor to the database because no value for the primary key SKU exists.</p>

			<h3>Update Anomaly</h3>
			<p>Repeating groups cause the <u><i>update anomaly</i></u>, which involves needing to change the same value more than once. If the Inventory table includes vendor contact info, and the vendor carries more than one inventory item, and the contact information for the vendor changes, it is necessary to find all references to that vendor in the table and update each separately.</p>
			<div class="table" style="font-size: 20px; border: 3px solid black">

			<h3>Delete Anomaly</h3>
			<p>The <u><i>delete anomaly</i></u> is the loss of unintended information when a record is removed. If the Inventory table includes vendor contact info, and the company decides to discontinue the only item carried by that vendor, deleting the inventory record will also delete the vendor contact info even if the company intended to business with that vendor in the future.</p>

			<h3>Normalization</h3>
			<p><u><i>Normalization</i></u> removes functional dependencies and their resulting anomalies by dividing non-normalized tables into multiple tables connected by foreign keys. Second normal form (2NF) removes partial dependencies, and third normal form (3NF) removes transitive dependencies. First normal form (1NF) also resolves anomalies, but it is too simplistic for our purposes. Third normal form is the minimum standard for a well-defined database.</p>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h3>Many-to-Many</h3>
			<p>One indication that a dependency exists is a relationship with maximum cardinalities of many in both directions. The resolution of this issue is a <u><i>linking table</i></u> that includes the primary keys of both original entities as a composite primary key. Because these are also the primary keys of another entity, they are simultaneously primary and foreign keys.</p>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h3>Indexing</h3>
			<p>One of the steps in the Maintenance section is indexing. This involves the creation of list of keys and pointers to increase the findability of those keys in a collection. One simple example of this is the index in the back of a textbook. The keywords are the keys, and the page numbers on which those keywords appear are the pointers. Database indices serve the same purpose. A single relation may have many records, and the DBMS may need a large number of processing cycles to find the records that a user wants. An index shrinks the size of the relation to a particular attribute and identifies which records in the relation have a particular key. This increases the speed of record retrieval.</p>
