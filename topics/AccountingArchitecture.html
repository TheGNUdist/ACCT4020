			<h2>Introduction to Accounting Architecture</h2>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h3>Professional Accountants</h3>
			<p>What skills have accounting firms requested?</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Data collection (Python, PERL, NoSQL)</li>
				<li>Data mining (SQL, R)</li>
				<li>Data analytics (Hadoop)</li>
				<li>Data visualization (OLAP)</li>
			</ul>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h3>What About &ldquo;Legacy Technologies&rdquo;?</h3>
			<p>Although Microsoft Excel and Access are not the best tools for data analysis and storage, because they are widely circulated spreadsheet and database applications, respectively, ability to use them continues to be valuable to employers.</p>
			<p>(However, I will not use these in this class. Instead, we will focus on enterprise-grade alternatives.)
		</section>

		<section>
			<h3>Information Is Money</h3>
			<p>What has precipitated the desire for these skills? <i>Big Data</i>.</p>
			<ul>
				<li>The world creates 2.5 quintillion bytes of data daily.</li>
				<ul>
					<li>1 quintillion bytes &asymp; 1 exabyte &asymp; 1 billion gigabytes</li>
				</ul>
				<li>More than 90&#37; of all data is less than 5 years old.</li>
				<li>Understanding this data unlocks insights into customer behavior, economic trends, future strategies, etc.</li>
			</ul>
			<blockquote>He uses his power and wealth to gain information. The more he acquires, the greater his power and wealth.<br>&ndash; Sherlock Holmes on Charles Magnussen</blockquote>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h3>Beyond Data Analytics</h3>
			<p>Data analysis is not the only relevant skill set. As custodians of information, accountants should participate in two other activities:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><u><i>Systems design</i></u> involves the identification of the roles the information system should play, the data the system should collect, and the information or reports the system should generate and the selection of technologies that build an information system to meet specifications.</li>
				<li><u><i>IT audit</i></u> verifies that an existing system meets control objectives to maintain data integrity and prevent unauthorized access.</li>
			</ul>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h3>Education</h3>
			<p>If these skills are desirable, the question that remains is whether the curriculum is designed to teach them.</p>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h3>Legacy Model</h3>
			<p>Accounting Information Systems</p>
			<div class="override"><img src="images/Legacy.png" alt="Legacy AIS model" style="max-width: 650px"/></div>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h3>Components of the Legacy Model</h3>
			<ul>
				<li>Data collection: Source documents that trigger the recording of journal entries.</li>
				<li>Data processing: Converting data from source documents into journal entries and ledger postings.</li>
				<li>Information reporting: Creating financial statements and internal reports from accounting records.</li>
				<li>Data storage: Accounting journals and ledgers, frequently in database form.</li>
			</ul>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h3>Teaching the Legacy Model</h3>
			<ol>
				<li>Explain source documents, accounting records and the audit trail from source documents to the general ledger and how enterprise resource planning (ERP) provides a centralized database system for accounting information.</li>
				<li>Introduce diagramming as a tool to understand and draw business cycles and databases.</li>
				<li>Teach how business cycles (revenue, expenditure and conversion) and their individual components (sales, cash receipts, purchases, cash disbursements, payroll, etc) should be, including internal controls, such as separation of duties, authorization and independent verification.</li>
				<li>Demonstrate a ledger system using Microsoft Access.</li>
			</ol>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h3>Limitations of the Legacy Model</h3>
			<ul>
				<li>Incomplete view of the information life cycle.</li>
				<li>Incomplete list of information system technologies.</li>
				<li>No reference to internal controls.</li>
				<li>No representation of relevant information system parameters.</li>
			</ul>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h3>Limitations in the Curriculum</h3>
			<ul>
				<li>Little to no exposure to information technology or data analysis.</li>
				<li>Outdated knowledge on enterprise-grade information system components (e.g., ERP implementations).</li>
				<li>Overreliance on prescribed business processes.</li>
				<li>Narrow focus on the general ledger component of the information system.</li>
				<li>Limited application of internal controls to business activities.</li>
			</ul>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h3>Accounting Architecture</h3>
			<div class="override"><img src="images/Arch5Color.png" alt="AA Arch" style="max-width: 325px"/></div>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h3>Why &ldquo;Accounting Architecture&rdquo;</h3>
			<blockquote>I would call someone who knew the business side and IT development an &ldquo;architect&rdquo;.<br>&ndash; Marcos Prieto, Fidelity Investments</blockquote>
			<p>A significant hurdle in industry is that business professionals cannot understand technology, and technologists cannot understand accounting. Accounting architects can bridge this gap.</p>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h3>Constraints</h3>
			<p>Three forces determine the boundaries of a useful information system:
			<ul>
				<li>Compliance</li>
				<li>Business Model</li>
				<li>Technological Feasibility</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Think of these as the foundation of a house. The foundation is not sufficient to determine the <em>best</em> building schematics, but it can exclude many incompatible blueprints.</p>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h3>Compliance</h3>
			<p>The primary focus on accounting curriculum is accounting rules and regulations. Financial accounting, audit and tax are rules-based, and any useful information system must generate information necessary to comply with these rules (e.g., financial statements, tax forms, etc).</p>
			<p>Compliance also addresses contractual relationships with lenders, suppliers and customers. Although these are not regulatory bodies, they may demand access to certain information or a certain level of security.</p>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h3>Business Model</h3>
			<p>Entrepreneurs and operations specialists generate business ideas and the model to execute those ideas. Accountants and information systems specialists report on the chosen model.</p>
			<p>As the information system collects data and reports on the existing business model, accountants can provide insights into potential modifications of the current model, as well as entirely new strategies. (Big Data analytics may be particularly useful for divining new strategies.)</p>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h3>Business Activities as a System</h3>
			<p>ISO 9001 states that managers should views business processes as a system. The relevant processes vary by business model (e.g., retail versus services), but all business models comprise multiple processes, and accountants must understand them in order to measure them. Process diagramming is a popular tool for visualizing and communicating business activities, and in addition to a familiarity with sample business activities&mdash;the revenue cycle may take on many forms, but a good example would contain components common to multiple implementations&mdash;the ability to read diagrams is a useful skill.</p>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h3>Technological Feasibility</h3>
			<p>Some technological solutions cannot exist (under current circumstances): humanoid robots, flying cars, speed-of-light travel, large-scale quantum computing. Information systems are subject to these constraints of the physical world.</p>
			<p>Some solutions <em>can</em> but have not <em>yet</em> existed. Because companies are unique, informational needs are unique. The correct information system to collect or create all desired data may require in-house development. Companies must determine whether the value of the information exceeds the development cost.</p>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h3>Information</h3>
			<p>The Information section of the arch comprises three blocks:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>Creation: data collection or acquisition and entry into the system.</li>
				<li>Use: data analysis and reporting.</li>
				<li>Maintenance: data storage and preservation.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>Each of these three blocks contain multiple steps. Together they form the information life cycle. Current employers have focused their attention on data analysis, but although Use is the culminating block of the Information section and the Architecture as a whole, knowledge of data analysis tools is incomplete without an understanding of the data and the process by which it becomes information.</p>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h3>Technology</h3>
			<p>The Technology section comprises four blocks:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>Hardware: the physical components of the information system.</li>
				<li>Software: server- and client-side applications.</li>
				<li>Storage: physical and logical data storage.</li>
				<li>Services: cloud computing.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>Whereas the Information section discusses the principles of information, these blocks represent the physical manifestation of the information system. This is my favorite part of the course. During this section of the course, we will have several practical exercises, and we will discuss how to submit the framework contribution group assignment.</p>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h3>Controls</h3>
			<p>The Controls section also comprises four blocks:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>Security: protecting unauthorized access.</li>
				<li>Availability: preventing data loss and system downtime.</li>
				<li>Processing Integrity: preventing data errors.</li>
				<li>Confidentiality: safeguarding personal and corporate secrets.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>These four blocks are the AICPA Trust Services Framework. Although many other control frameworks exist, I have selected this one for the Accounting Architecture because it focuses on data security and because the profession's governing body already supports it.</p>

			<h3>Benefits of Accounting Architecture</h3>
			<div class="flex-row">
				<div class="flex-item override"><img src="images/Arch5Color.png" alt="AA Arch" style="max-width: 300px"/></div>
				<div class="flex-item" style="max-width: 65%">
					<ul>
						<li>Combines information, technology and controls into one model.</li>
						<li>Presents the information life cycle as understood by information scientists.</li>
						<li>Introduces students to current data storage and analysis technologies.</li>
						<li>Places the components of the information system in context with accounting regulations.</li>
						<li>Identifies business processes as the <i>foundation</i> of the information system, not the information system <i>itself</i>.</li>
					</ul>
				</div>
			</div>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h3>Why AA Matters to You</h3>
			<p>I believe that my view of accounting information systems in the form of Accounting Architecture is more complete and accurate than the models used in other courses, but my motivation is not to promote my belief.</p>
			<p>I developed the Accounting Architecture because employers demand accountants with the ability to understand data and audit information systems. Even if only some students will pursue this career path, this modification to the curriculum will improve these individuals' preparation and future opportunities.</p> 
		</section>

		<section>
			<h3>Some Specifics</h3>
			<ul>
				<li>Two of the four Big 4 accounting firms have released white papers proposing additions to the current curriculum covering data analytics and information system technologies.</li>
				<li>Partners from KPMG and PwC have expressed interest in hiring more accountants with IT knowledge.</li>
				<li>Effective Fall 2015, Fogelman offers an additional MS in Accounting track for data analytics, as well as a certificate in Business Intelligence and Analysis.</li>
				<li>Linux is the most widely adopted enterprise operating system, and nine in ten managers plan to hire a Linux professional in the next six months.</li>
			</ul>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h3>Take Aways</h3>
			<ul>
				<li>In order to meet current demands, accountants should be able to serve as data analysts and IT auditors.</li>
				<li>Both data analysts and IT auditors need an understanding of the whole information system: information, technology and control.</li>
				<li>Accounting Architecture modifies the current accounting information systems curriculum to provide this knowledge.</li>
			</ul>
