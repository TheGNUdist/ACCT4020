			<h2>Introduction to Accounting Architecture</h2>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h3>Professional Accountants</h3>
			<p>What skills have accounting firms requested?</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Data collection (Python, PERL, NoSQL)</li>
				<li>Data mining (SQL, R)</li>
				<li>Data analytics (Hadoop)</li>
				<li>Data visualization (OLAP)</li>
			</ul>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h3>Information Is Money</h3>
			<p>What has precipitated the desire for these skills? <i>Big Data</i>.</p>
			<ul>
				<li>The world creates 2.5 quintillion bytes of data daily.</li>
				<ul>
					<li>1 quintillion bytes &asymp; 1 exabyte &asymp; 1 billion gigabytes</li>
				</ul>
				<li>More than 90% of all data is less than 5 years old.</li>
				<li>Understanding this data unlocks insights into customer behavior, economic trends, future strategies, etc.</li>
			</ul>
			<blockquote>He uses his power and wealth to gain information. The more he acquires, the greater his power and wealth.<br>&ndash; Sherlock Holmes on Charles Magnussen</blockquote>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h3>Beyond Data Analytics</h3>
			<p>Data analysis is not the only relevant skill set. As custodians of information, accountants should participate in two other activities:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><u><i>Systems design</i></u> involves the identification of the roles the information system should play, the data the system should collect, and the information or reports the system should generate and the selection of technologies that build an information system to meet specifications.</li>
				<li><u><i>IT audit</i></u> verifies that an existing system meets control objectives to maintain data integrity and prevent unauthorized access.</li>
			</ul>

		<section>
			<h3>The Elephant in the Room</h3>
			<p>The title of this course in the catalog is &ldquo;Accounting Systems&rdquo;. In prior semesters this has caused confusion regarding the nature of this course. This course is more appropriately, and more traditionally, called &ldquo;Accounting Information Systems&rdquo; because the purpose is to teach the information system from the perspective of an accountant. Perhaps, a better title would be &ldquo;Information Technology for Accountants&rdquo; or &ldquo;Information Systems Architecture.&rdquo; I use &ldquo;Accounting Architecture.&rdquo;</p>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h3>Why &ldquo;Accounting Architecture&rdquo;</h3>
			<blockquote>I would call someone who knew the business side and IT development an &ldquo;architect&rdquo;.<br>&ndash; Marcos Prieto, Fidelity Investments</blockquote>
			<p>A significant hurdle in industry is that business professionals cannot understand technology, and technologists cannot understand accounting. Accounting architects can bridge this gap.</p>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h3>Constraints</h3>
			<p>Three forces determine the boundaries of a useful information system:
			<ul>
				<li><u><i>Compliance</i></u></li>
				<li><u><i>Business Model</i></u></li>
				<li><u><i>Technological Feasibility</i></u></li>
			</ul>
			<p>Think of these as the foundation of a house. The foundation is not sufficient to determine the <em>best</em> building schematics, but it can exclude many incompatible blueprints.</p>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h3>Compliance</h3>
			<p>The primary focus on accounting curriculum is accounting rules and regulations. Financial accounting, audit, and tax are rules-based, and any useful information system must generate information necessary to comply with these rules (e.g., financial statements, tax forms, etc.).</p>
			<p>Compliance also addresses contractual relationships with lenders, suppliers, and customers. Although these are not regulatory bodies, they may demand access to certain information or a certain level of security.</p>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h3>Business Model</h3>
			<p>Entrepreneurs and operations specialists generate business ideas and the model to execute those ideas. Accountants and information systems specialists report on the chosen model.</p>
			<p>As the information system collects data and reports on the existing business model, accountants can provide insights into potential modifications of the current model, as well as entirely new strategies. (Big Data analytics may be particularly useful for divining new strategies.)</p>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h3>Business Activities as a System</h3>
			<p>ISO 9001 states that managers should views business processes as a system. The relevant processes vary by business model (e.g., retail versus services), but all business models comprise multiple processes, and accountants must understand them in order to measure them. Process diagramming is a popular tool for visualizing and communicating business activities, and the ability to read diagrams is a useful skill.</p>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h3>Technological Feasibility</h3>
			<p>Some technological solutions cannot exist (under current circumstances): humanoid robots, flying cars, speed-of-light travel, large-scale quantum computing. Information systems are subject to these constraints of the physical world.</p>
			<p>Some solutions <em>can</em> but have not <em>yet</em> existed. Because companies are unique, informational needs are unique. The correct information system to collect or create all desired data may require in-house development. Companies must determine whether the value of the information exceeds the development cost.</p>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h3>Information</h3>
			<p>The Information section of the arch comprises three blocks:</p>
			<ol>
				<li><u><i>Creation</i></u>: data collection or acquisition and entry into the system.</li>
				<li><u><i>Use</i></u>: data analysis and reporting.</li>
				<li><u><i>Maintenance</i></u>: data storage and preservation.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>Each of these three blocks contains multiple steps. Together they form the information life cycle. Current employers have focused their attention on data analysis, but although Use is the culminating block of the Information section and the Architecture as a whole, knowledge of data analysis tools is incomplete without an understanding of the data and the process by which it becomes information.</p>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h3>Technology</h3>
			<p>The Technology section comprises four blocks:</p>
			<ol>
				<li><u><i>Hardware</i></u>: the physical components of the information system.</li>
				<li><u><i>Software</i></u>: server- and client-side applications.</li>
				<li><u><i>Storage</i></u>: physical and logical data storage.</li>
				<li><u><i>Services</i></u>: cloud computing.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>Whereas the Information section discusses the principles of information, the Technology blocks represent the physical manifestation of the information system.</p>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h3>Technology Forecast</h3>
			<p>During the Technology section of the course, we will discuss servers, workstations, mainframes, thin clients, operating systems (kernels and userland), relational and non-relational databases, data analytics, virtualization and containerization, software development, networking, and cloud computing.</p>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h3>Controls</h3>
			<p>The Controls section also comprises four blocks:</p>
			<ol>
				<li><u><i>Security</i></u>: protecting unauthorized access.</li>
				<li><u><i>Availability</i></u>: preventing data loss and system downtime.</li>
				<li><u><i>Processing Integrity</i></u>: preventing data errors.</li>
				<li><u><i>Confidentiality</i></u>: safeguarding personal and corporate secrets.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>These four blocks are the AICPA Trust Services Framework. Although many other control frameworks exist, I have selected this because it focuses on data security. With the rise in cybersecurity threats, information security has become increasingly important, and accountants are particularly interested in compliance with good control practices.</p>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h3>Control Forecast</h3>
			<p>During the Control section of the course, we will discuss permissions, authentication, encryption (using Bitcoin as a context), data entry controls, transaction processing, and redundancy.</p>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h3>Benefits of Accounting Architecture</h3>
			<div class="flex-row">
				<div class="flex-item override"><img src="../../images/Arch5Color.png" alt="AA Arch" style="max-width: 300px"/></div>
				<div class="flex-item" style="max-width: 65%">
					<ul>
						<li>Presents the information life cycle as understood by information scientists.</li>
						<li>Combines information, technology and controls into one model.</li>
						<li>Introduces students to current enterprise-grade information technologies.</li>
						<li>Places the components of the information system in context with accounting regulations.</li>
					</ul>
				</div>
			</div>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h3>Accounting Tie-Ins</h3>
			<p>Some students feel that these IT-related topics are not relevant to them and that they would prefer to focus on accounting regulations. I accept that it is my responsibility to prove otherwise. As a result, in each lecture I will try to include &ldquo;Accounting Tie-in&rdquo; slides in an attempt to emphasize how Accounting Architecture &ldquo;places the components of the information systems in context with accounting regulations,&rdquo; or in other words, how an Accounting Architecture principle matters to accountants.</p>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h3>The &ldquo;Big&rdquo; Tie-in</h3>
			<p>I developed the Accounting Architecture because employers want accountants with the ability to understand data and audit information systems.</p> 
			<ul>
				<li>Two Big 4 accounting firms have proposed additions to the current curriculum covering information system technologies.</li>
				<li>Partners from KPMG and PwC have expressed interest in hiring more accountants with IT knowledge.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Effective Fall 2015, Fogelman offers an additional MS in Accounting track for data analytics, as well as a certificate in Business Intelligence and Analysis. Even if only some students pursue this career path, this modification to the curriculum will improve these individuals' preparation and future opportunities.</p>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h3>What About &ldquo;Legacy Technologies&rdquo;?</h3>
			<p>PwC lists Microsoft Excel and Access as &ldquo;legacy technologies,&rdquo; and they continue to be valuable, especially Excel. However, these are &ldquo;business tools&rdquo; and not information technologies. As a result, they are not the best tools for data storage or analysis, although they are frequently used for these purposes. In this course, we will focus on enterprise-grade information systems, and we will not discuss these legacy business tools.</p>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h3>What About Quickbooks, etc?</h3>
			<p>Small and large businesses have different informational needs, different technological needs, and different abilities to hire IT staff to manage information systems. As a result, small firms may rely on small-business accounting applications, such as Quickbooks. Expertise with these tools may be useful in working as a bookkeeper in a small business, but the focus of this course is not on bookkeeping tools.</p>
		</section>
		
		<section>
			<h3>Next Steps</h3>
			<p>Before we begin our discussion of the information life cycle, the first component of the accounting architecture, we will first explore a concept that heavily influences all facets of information and information technology today: open content. In our next lesson, we will investigate the meaning of this concept and its origins.</p>
